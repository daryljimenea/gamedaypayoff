                    <p class="whitebodytext">14.   Applicable Law</p>
                    <p class="whitebodytext">By   accessing or using the GAMEDAY PAYOFF Application or our services, you agree   that the substantive laws of the State of Missouri in the United States of   America shall govern all matters relating to or arising from this Agreement, and   the use (or inability to use) any or all of the services or the GAMEDAY PAYOFF   Application, and that such laws shall apply without regard to principles of   conflict of laws. Subject to the dispute resolution procedures set forth below,   you hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the appropriate   State and Federal courts located in St. Louis, Missouri, with respect to all   matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement. The United Nations   Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to   this Agreement. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary,   any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the GAMEDAY   PAYOFF Service, any GAMEDAY PAYOFF Application or the GAMEDAY PAYOFF Privacy   Policy must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action   arose or be forever barred.</p>
                    <p class="whitebodytext">15.   Arbitration</p>
                    <p class="whitebodytext">Any claim   or controversy arising out of or related to this Agreement, or the products or   services we provide or distribute shall be settled by individual binding   arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association   then effective. Any such claim or controversy shall be arbitrated on an   individual basis and shall not be consolidated with a claim of any other party.   Further, in any such dispute, under no circumstances will you be permitted to   obtain awards for, and you hereby waive all rights to claim punitive, incidental   or consequential damages, and you further waive all rights to have damages   multiplied or increased. This shall not preclude GAMEDAY PAYOFF from seeking any   injunctive relief for protection of our Intellectual Property Rights. The   arbitration shall take place in St. Louis, Missouri or such other location as   the parties may mutually agree. The arbitrator(s) shall issue a reasoned award,   and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in   any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator(s) will each be a natural   person who has never been employed (either as an employee or as an independent   consultant) by either of the parties, or any parent, subsidiary or affiliate   thereof, and will be generally familiar with the business of the parties. The   arbitrator(s) may upon request exclude from use in the arbitration proceeding   any evidence not made available to the other party pursuant to a proper   discovery request. The cost of the arbitration will be borne equally by the   parties. The parties, their representatives, other participants, the   arbitrator(s) and the administrator(s) of the arbitration will hold in   confidence the existence, content and outcome of the arbitration. The parties   understand that: (i) arbitration is final and binding on the parties; (ii) the   parties are waiving their right to seek remedies in court, including the right   to a jury trial; (iii) pre-arbitration discovery is generally more limited than   and different from court procedures; and (iv) any party's right to appeal or to   seek modification of rulings by the arbitrators is strictly limited.</p>
                    <p class="whitebodytext">16.   Successor Agreements</p>
                    <p class="whitebodytext">The terms   of this Agreement may change from time to time. You should check back at the   website regularly to determine if any material changes have been made. We will   prominently post material changes on the GAMEDAY PAYOFF website at least 14 days   prior to the effective date of the change and will also attempt to provide you   with an on-line notice informing you when such material changes have been made   to this Agreement, which notice shall contain an active link that you can use to   view a web page containing or linking to the revised Agreement.</p>
                    <p class="whitebodytext">You agree   that your continued use of any GAMEDAY PAYOFF Application or our services after   the effective date of any change to this Agreement will constitute your   affirmative consent to this revised Agreement. If you do not accept such   revisions, you must affirmatively indicate to us by e-mail that you do not   accept the successor Agreement and remove all of our GAMEDAY PAYOFF Applications   from your computer and cease all access to and use of our services hereunder.   Failure to remove our GAMEDAY PAYOFF Applications from your computer will be   deemed an acceptance of the terms of the most current Agreement.</p>
                    <p class="whitebodytext">17. Order   of Precedence</p>
                    <p class="whitebodytext">This   Agreement and any accepted successor Agreement governs your use of our GAMEDAY   PAYOFF Applications and our services as described herein. To the extent that any   provision of this Agreement, or any supplemental agreement offered as any part   of any registration for additional GAMEDAY PAYOFF Applications or services,   conflicts with any provision of other agreements between you and GAMEDAY PAYOFF   or any of its related or affiliated entities, the terms of the then-current   Agreement, shall, as to the specific subject matter of this Agreement, take   precedence over the conflicting term(s) of that other agreement</p>
                    <p class="whitebodytext">18.   General</p>
                    <p class="whitebodytext">This   Agreement, as modified from time to time as described above, and including the   GAMEDAY PAYOFF Privacy Policy, Terms of Service and any other policies   incorporated by reference, sets forth the entire understanding and agreement   between the parties. No delay or failure to enforce any provision of this   Agreement will constitute a waiver of such provision by GAMEDAY PAYOFF or acts   as estoppel against later enforcement. Subject to the terms of the Order of   Precedence set forth above, this Agreement constitutes the entire agreement   between you and GAMEDAY PAYOFF with respect to the specific subject matter   addressed herein, and governs your use of the GAMEDAY PAYOFF Application and our   services, superseding any prior agreements between you and GAMEDAY PAYOFF or its   affiliates or related entities relating to such subject matter, but this   Agreement may be supplemented by any other agreement you enter into with GAMEDAY   PAYOFF or its affiliates or related entities pursuant to a registration to   access additional software or services provided by GAMEDAY PAYOFF. You may not   assign any of your rights or delegate any of your obligations under this   Agreement without the prior written consent of GAMEDAY PAYOFF. GAMEDAY PAYOFF   shall not be deemed to be in breach of this Agreement due to any delay or   failure of performance or interruption in the availability of the Services   resulting directly or indirectly from any act of nature or other cause beyond   the reasonable control of GAMEDAY PAYOFF. If any provision of this Agreement is   found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties   nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties'   intentions as reflected in the provision, and that the other provisions of this   Agreement remain in full force and effect. Sections 2-4, 7-15 and 18 of this   Agreement will survive any expiration, cancellation or termination of this   Agreement. The section headings used in this Agreement are for convenience only   and have no legal or contractual effect.</p>
