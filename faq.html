                      <span class="whitebodytext">Using GameDay Payoff software for  anyone of its three intended uses is absolutely legal.  Those intended uses are as follows:</span></span></p>
                    <ul class="whitebodytext">
                      <ul><li>
                        <div align="left"> Recreationally running  and participating in a fantasy sportsbook in which the &quot;Book&quot;  simulates a sportsbook scenario and his &quot;Players&quot; submit  &quot;wagers&quot; in hopes of having the highest gains at the end of a  determined period of time.</div>
                      </li>
                        <li>
                          <div align="left">                            Professionally recording  real wagers that were placed within legal jurisdictions in order to better  track, analyze, and evaluate personal aspects of the profession (or hobby) of  sports wagering.</div>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <div align="left">                            Educating oneself in  the virtues of sports wagering with the intent of applying such knowledge to  formatively placing actual wagers within legal jurisdictions.</div>
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                    </ul>
                    <p align="left" class="whitebodytext">While it is conceivable that  GameDay Payoff can be used in other capacities, it is these three in which  GameDay Payoff was specifically designed for.   It is up to each individual to be informed of all governing laws before  using GameDay Payoff for any use other than these three in which it was  designed for and released to the public for.</p>
                    <p align="left" class="whitebodytext"><span class="orangeboldtext">Why should I use a Direct  Connection with my Book/Players?</span><br />
                      <span class="whitebodytext">Quite simply, a Direct Connection  is the optimal way to run your Book or be a Player.  Direct Connection is a communication tool  that allows Books and Players to operate directly through the GameDay Payoff  software application.  Direct Connection  transmits and receives from one application to another directly through the  internet without that transmission passing through our servers at any  time.  By using Direct Connection, you  and your Book/Player open your world to 24/7 wagering, advanced wagering that  only internet sportsbook's or Las    Vegas offers, controlled line movement, exposure  management, and persistent balance checking.   What you eliminate by using a Direct Connection between you and your  Book/Player is the hassle of phone communication, mistakes, minimal wager  offerings, missed calls, blind-sided line changes, limited time slots to place  wagers, and out of balance results.
                        </p>
                      </span>                      </p>
                    <p class="whitebodytext">If you are a Book, to begin  experiencing this benefit, go to the Player Manager and create an Invite for a  Player.  Then send it to that  Player.  It's just that Easy!</p>
                    <p class="whitebodytext">If you are a Player, to experience  this benefit, have your Book send you an Invite and then go to Add Book and  select Direct Connection after assigning a name and opening balance.  Import the invitation file that your Book  sent you, enter the password he provided to you, and then you are all set up  and ready to go.  It's really that Easy!</p>
                    <p class="whitebodytext"><span class="orangeboldtext">Why am I having difficulties  connecting to my Book/Players?</span><br />
                      Assuming both went through the  invite process and initially established a connection, you both need to be  connected to the internet at the same time.   If the Player is connected to the internet, than what color ball is  being displayed in the lower left hand corner.   If it is gray then the Book is either not on the internet or, if he is  on the internet, must go through a process to determine why he is not  broadcasting to his Players.  For the  Book, this process is provided in great detail in the “Direct Connection Books  Must Receive Signal” topic in your Help section.  For a Player, if the ball is red in the lower  left hand corner, that means that he is failing to authenticate you as a  registered Player with him.  This could  be due to unforseen technical difficulties or he has decided to revoke your  Direct Connection privileges by making you Inactive.  If he has revoked your privileges, the Book  setting your status back to Active will result in authentication.  As soon as you know you are Active again,  close the application and re-open it.   You should have a green ball with the Book and be authenticated.  If this does not occur and you are still not  authenticated, then have him send you another Invite and Re-Register </p>
                    <p class="whitebodytext"><span class="orangeboldtext">I have no idea what my password  is and cannot figure it out from the hint.   How do I log into my application?</span><br />
                      If you  are using the Book application or are the sole Administrator on the Player  Application and forget your password when the application is password  protected, you will NEVER GAIN ACCESS to the application again.  There is no hidden password or means of  getting around a forgotten password.  The  password is case sensitive, so try different cases before giving up.  If you cannot discover your password, you  will have to uninstall the application and start everything all over.  If you are on the Player application, all  Players will lose their records and settings if you uninstall the application  and start over.  If you are not the sole  Administrator and have forgotten your password, just have the Administrator go  into User Profiles and reset it,  You may  then change it to what ever you would like. </p>
                    <p class="whitebodytext"><span class="orangeboldtext">Why are games expired when they  have not started yet?</span><br />
                      If you are a Book, you will no  longer accept wagers that are placed after your computer time becomes that of  the games.  If you are a Player, closing  the Place Wager screen and re-opening it will cause games to disappear that  have a game time of that earlier than your computer time.  In both instances, the game may not have  started yet, but there is no wager that can be placed or accepted.  That is why it is very important to make sure  that your computer is accurate.   Furthermore, if the game has not begun yet and you still want to place  or take a wager, you may still do so by other means of communication and enter  it into the Record Wager screen.</p>
                    <p class="whitebodytext"><span class="orangeboldtext">Why are games still showing up  on the Place Wager screen (Player app only) when they have already begun?</span><br />
                      Games that have already begun will  disappear only after closing and re-opening the screen.</p>
                    <p class="whitebodytext"><span class="orangeboldtext">Why aren’t policy changes being  reflected on my screens?</span><br />
                      Any screens that were open at the  time the Policy change was made, must be closed and then re-opened for those  changes to take affect.</p>
                    <p class="whitebodytext"><span class="orangeboldtext">In the Place Wagers screen  (Player app only), what is the difference between sending wagers directly to  the Book or sending them for Review?</span><br />
                      When you send them directly to the  Book, they go straight to him without any further evaluation.  Specifically, you do not get a chance to step  back and look at the big picture of just what and how much you will be placing  as a whole.  By not doing so, it is  possible that you may exceed your Book imposed limit while sending.  If this happens, wagers you really wanted to  be placed may not be accepted because you exceeded your limit.</p>
                    <p class="whitebodytext">On the other hand, sending your  wagers first to review allows you to step back and look at the big picture  before sending.  Here, you can see just  how much you are sending and make adjustments to make sure that all of what you  are sending will be accepted.</p>
                    <p class="whitebodytext"><span class="orangeboldtext">What is the difference between  using the Place Wager screen and the Record Wager screen?</span><br />
                      The difference between Place Wager  and Record Wager is that with Place Wager, you are currently connected to a  Book and you are directly placing that wager with your Book and it is also  being recorded on your computer.  With Record  Wager, you are not placing a wager directly with the Book through GameDay  Payoff, but are only recording it on your computer.  The communication of this wager is fulfilled  through some other means.  To accommodate,  lines are editable from the Record Wager's screen, but not from the Place Wager  screen.  The lines in the Place Wager  screen are coming directly from the Book and are, therefore, not editable.</p>
                    <p class="whitebodytext">Also, a wager made through the  Place Wager screen that is accepted by the Book cannot be edited or  deleted.  To accommodate mistaken entries  or miscommunications, a wager that is made entered on the Record Wager screen  can be edited or deleted. </p>
                    <p class="whitebodytext">Use Place Wager screen for the  following (Book must have a green ball associated with it):</p>
                    <ul class="whitebodytext">
                      <li>Using a Book that is currently connected and the game you  are wagering has not begun yet</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="whitebodytext">Use Record Wager screen for the  following:</p>
                    <ul class="whitebodytext">
                      <li>Using a Book for which you have never connected with</li>
                      <li>Using a Book for which you typically are connected with and  use the Place Wagers screen, but communicated a wager to in a means other than  using GameDay Payoff.  This applies to  wagers for games that have not began yet or have expired (game has began or has  ended)</li>
                      <li>Using a Book that is non-GameDay Payoff related.  If your Book is Las Vegas, the internet, or some other,  GameDay Payoff can still be used for bookkeeping and real-time wager status.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="whitebodytext"><span class="orangeboldtext">Why does a Direct Connection  Book have a different balance than me?</span><br />
                      The balance you see on the  Balances screen and the Wager Manager screens come directly from the Book and  are indicated as such.  There are two  reasons why the Book would have a different balance than you.  The first reason being that your transactions  are not the same on the Balances screen.   The Balances screen allows for you to receive, pay, or make  adjustments.  If these transactions do  not match, the balances will not be the same.</p>
                    <p class="whitebodytext">The second reason would be from  the Book and you entering different (or failing to enter) wagers on the Record  wager screen.  If a wager was taken  manually instead of through a Direct Connection, both of you would had to have  entered that wager on the Record Wager screen.   If different wagers were entered or not entered at all, the Book would  be showing a different balance than you.   Wagers using the Place Wager screen would be the same on both sides and  would, therefore, not be the cause of the Book having a different balance than  you.</p>
                    <p class="whitebodytext"><span class="orangeboldtext">I have the Book or Player  application, but not the other.  How do I  get the other application installed?</span><br />
                      If you only have the GameDay  Payoff - Book application or the GameDay Payoff - Player application and desire  to have both, please double-click on the  &quot;gamedaypayoffinstaller.exe&quot;.   You might either have this file already or you can download it from  www.gamedaypayoff.com.  Upon opening the  file, you will choose the Modify option in the installer.  Then check the application you want to have  and proceed with the installation.  It's  that easy!</p>
                    <p class="whitebodytext"><span class="orangeboldtext">What does SVS Data Feed Error in  the lower right hand corner mean?</span><br />
                      It means that you either do not  have an internet connection or we are experiencing technical difficulties.  If you do not have an internet connection,  you will be informed of this with a message on the bottom of the  application.  If you do have an internet  connection, then the problem is from us.   If it is from us, please be patient while we address the problem</p>
                    <p class="whitebodytext"><span class="orangeboldtext">Can I transfer my records to  another computer?</span><br />
                      With one exception, you can move  entire databases from one computer to another.   However, you cannot move just one Player from one GameDay Payoff  application to another GameDay Payoff application.  The entire database (with ALL Players) needs  to move or nothing.  If you are a Book,  your entire database is just the one Book because you can only have one Book  per application.</p>
                    <p class="whitebodytext">The one exception to moving the entire  database (for either) is that if you installed both applications on the same  computer and now need them on separate computers, it will not work.  You will need to uninstall and start from the  beginning for one of the applications.   You can take your pick on which one you would like to remove.  However, if you do find yourself needing to  transfer both of the applications to another computer, that can easily be  accomplished.</p>
                    <p class="whitebodytext">All you need to do is move the  database from the computer you are on, to the computer you want to use.  However, copying the same database and  running it on two different computers at the same time will not work.  Neither can you merge databases if you have  been working on two different computers and wish to combine the data.  If, after following the instructions below,  your application does not accept the transfer based on the subscription, please  see &quot;Validate Subscription&quot; in the Help section.</p>
                    <p class="whitebodytext">To transfer your settings  (including subscription validation) and wagers to a new computer, do as  follows:</p>

                    <p class="whitebodytext"><span class="orangeboldtext">I keep getting subscription validation  errors upon startup?</span><br />
                      The &quot;Validate Subscription on  this Computer&quot; dialog will come up for a variety of reasons, but they all  reflect the same issue.  When GameDay  Payoff (Player and/or Book) is initially installed on your computer, the  application(s) is assigned a unique subscription key (or number) that is  registered with us.  This unique  subscription key cannot be changed.  The  only time this unique registration key will be the same on two different  applications is when a Player application and a Book application are installed  on the same computer.  Installing on  different computers and transferring to the same computer does not result in  the same subscription key.</p>
                    <p class="whitebodytext">At any one time, only one occurrence  of that unique subscription key can be receiving data from us unless those  identical subscription keys are on the same computer.  That is why a Player and a Book that were  installed on the same computer, and assigned the same unique subscription key  because of that, will work so long as they are always on the same computer  together.  If the Player or Book  application is transferred to another computer, while the other remains, either  one or the other can be running for it to work properly.  Additionally, there may be a requirement to  keep validating the subscription every time you launch.</p>
                    <p class="whitebodytext">If there is ever an instance by  which you cannot validate the subscription, that means that there is an  application currently running on another machine that is sharing your unique  subscription key.  The only way this  could occur is if there is a copy of your database on another computer running  at the same time or Book and Player applications that were originally installed  on the same computer are running at the same time.  In either case, you will not be able to run  your application until that application with your unique subscription key shuts  down.</p>
                    <p class="whitebodytext">If you are aware of who might be  sharing your unique subscription key, it is best to have them get their own  application and their own database.  If  you do not know who is sharing your subscription key or cannot get them to  stop, you will need to uninstall whichever application you are having trouble  with and re-install it.  Of course, this  will lead to you starting over.</p>
                    <p class="whitebodytext"><span class="orangeboldtext">As a Book, can I offer different  lines to different Players?</span><br />
                      Yes and no.  The Line Monitor is not dependant on which  Player is selected in the Player dropdown list.   The Line Monitor always broadcasts the lines that are there to ALL  Players.  However, you can just tell them  a different line and manually enter it.   Keep in mind when doing this that, if they are a Direct Connection  Player, they will be able to see the line being broadcast if you are online.</p>                    </td>
