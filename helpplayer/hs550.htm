<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Juice is the amount you pay in excess of your loss.&nbsp; For more on what Juice is, refer to Juice in the Wager Types section of the Help.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">This screen will reflect the amount of Juice assigned by the Book.&nbsp; Each field is the percentage.&nbsp; Hence, for 10% Juice, you would enter a 10 into one of the fields.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Juice is broken down into straight spreads, straight totals, parlay, teasers, pleasers, and action points.&nbsp; There is no juice on a money line.&nbsp; Within each of these wager types, Juice can be assigned for a loss or push with minimums for each.&nbsp; Minimums mean that either the percent or minimum will be enforced, whichever is higher.&nbsp; There is never Juice on a win and for action points, the Juice is not per point, but for the entire amount.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Typical Juice amounts are 10% for straight wagers and action points with regard to losses only.&nbsp; Minimums sometimes are enforced.
