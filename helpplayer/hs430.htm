<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Wager Manager serves as the headquarters for all wagers.&nbsp; The Wager Manager tracks wagers as they go through various stages.&nbsp; They are as follows:</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">1)&nbsp; Review:&nbsp; A wager that has not yet been sent, has expired, or has failed to be accepted by the Book ends up here for further action.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">2)&nbsp; Open:&nbsp; A wager that the Book currently has accepted, but is not yet resolved.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">3)&nbsp; In Progress:&nbsp; An Open wager that currently has a game being played that will affect a wager.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">4)&nbsp; Closed:&nbsp; A wager that the Book currently has that is resolved.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">All wager tabs (or stages) have much in common.&nbsp; They are as follows:</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><U>Wager Types:</U>&nbsp;&nbsp; There is Straight, Parlay (#plays), Teaser (#plays),(#points), Pleaser (#plays),(#points), and Action Points (cap)</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><U>Bet Option:</U>&nbsp; It will always be Spread, Over, Under, or Money Line.&nbsp; It is blank on the main line of a Multi-Play wager, but contained within the plays.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><U>Overall Limit:</U>&nbsp; The amount of exposure that the Book is willing to have with you.&nbsp; This comes from Policy.&nbsp; If "All" is chosen from the Book list, this field is empty.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><U>*Current Balance:</U>&nbsp; The current balance you have with the Book.&nbsp; For a Direct Connection Book, this amount comes directly from them to you so it reflects what they show on their end.&nbsp; For a manual Book, this amount reflects what you show on your side.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><U>Open Balance:</U>&nbsp; The amount of wagers that the Book currently has accepted, but is not yet resolved.&nbsp; The amount used for this treats every wager as if it is a loss and, therefore, includes the juice.&nbsp; For a Direct Connection Book, this amount comes directly from them to you so it reflects what they show on their end.&nbsp; For a manual Book, this amount reflects what you show on your side.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><U>Available to Wager:</U>&nbsp; The amount that you can wager with.&nbsp; It is calculated by subtracting or adding the Current Balance (depending on if you're in the red or black) to the Overall Limit and then subtracting the Open Balance from that.&nbsp; If "All" is chosen from the Book list, this field is empty.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><U>Send Amount:</U>&nbsp; The amount that you are going to send to the Book from the Review tab.&nbsp; This is only available to those Books for which you have a </FONT><A HREF="hs40.htm"><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Direct Connection</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> with.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><U>Limit Management:</U>&nbsp; The amount you have available to wager (Available to Wager) minus the amount you are about to send (Send Amount).&nbsp; This is only available to those Books for which you have a </FONT><A HREF="hs40.htm"><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Direct Connection</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> with.&nbsp; If the Limit Management goes negative, you will not be allowed to send any wagers until you lower the send amount and get the Limit Management positive.&nbsp; If "All" is chosen from the Book list, this field is empty.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><U>*Current (bold):</U>&nbsp; The current balance that you show with the Book.&nbsp; This balance comes from you regardless of if it is a Manual Book or a Direct Connection Book.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><U>Winning/Losing (bold):</U>&nbsp; Assuming the outcomes remain as they are at that moment, it is the balance of all wagers which currently have games being played.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><U>Current + Winning/Losing (bold):</U>&nbsp; The expected balance that you will have with the Book given that the outcomes of games currently being played remain as they are.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">*If the Current in bold does not match the Current Balance being broadcast from a Direct Connection Book, there are probably manual wagers entered by you or him through the Record Wager screen that the other has not OR there have been entries made through Balances by one of you that the other has not made yet.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>The table in the upper right always reflects the Wager List</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><U>Summary (table in upper right):</U>&nbsp; Breakdowns of wager types in their most basic form.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><U>Detail (table in upper right):</U>&nbsp; Breaks down each wager type even further.&nbsp; Straights become spreads, totals, and money lines while multi-plays are broken down into the number of plays.&nbsp; Action Points are broken down into the individual action point caps</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><U>Specific (table in upper right):</U>&nbsp; Breaks straight wagers down even further into the favorites and underdogs of each of spreads, totals, and money lines.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><U>Expanded view of multi-play wagers:</U>&nbsp; checking this box will expand all multi-play wagers so that you may see the individual plays within that multi-play wager.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><U>View (General or Specific):</U>&nbsp; Changing the view changes the headers (or labels) for the columns.&nbsp; The general view always offers the same headers regardless of what tab you are in while the specific view gives more relevant information to the related tab.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">A wager that has a red X (or delete) next to it was manually entered through the Record Wager screen.&nbsp; Since these wagers are recorded internally only, they may be deleted.&nbsp; If a wager does not have a red X next to it, that means that it was entered through the Place Wager screen and accepted by your Book via the </FONT><A HREF="hs40.htm"><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Direct Connection</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">.&nbsp; Because your Book receives these wagers directly from you at the time they are placed, these wagers cannot be deleted.</FONT><BR>
