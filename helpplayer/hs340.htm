<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Money lines do not have a spread to cover. You wager on who you think will win the game or event, whether it's the favorite or the underdog. Money lines are based on a $100 parameter. Basically, you will risk more to win less if you bet on the favorite and risk less to win more if you bet on the underdog. On certain sports or events you may be able to make an even wager, which means that you win the same amount as you bet.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">For example:</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Miami Heat -220</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Washington Wizards +185</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In this example, a wager on the Miami Heat to win means that you bet $220 to win $100. A wager on the Washington Wizards means you bet $100 to win $180. A tie results in a push.
