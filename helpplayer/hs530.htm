<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Policy is the limits, rules, and odds that the Book sets for the Player.&nbsp; Changing Policy only affects new wagers.&nbsp; Changing Policy will never be applied to an Open or Closed wager.&nbsp; Policy is derived by one of two ways.&nbsp; If it came from a Direct Connection Book, it came from him and it can only be modified by him.&nbsp; When a Direct Connection Book changes your Policy, you will receive a notification that such a change has occurred.&nbsp; It is then recommended that you close and re-open any screens that the new Policy may affect or just close and re-open the application.&nbsp; Again, Policy from a Direct Connection Book is not modifiable by the Player.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">If the Policy is for a Manual Book, it was entered by you based off of his Policy that he communicated to you and it can be changed by you.&nbsp; For obvious reasons, it is very important that your Policy represents the same Policy that your Book has.&nbsp; Because odds and rules are referenced for wager calculations, both sides will only match if you each have the same Policy.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Policy for either a Direct Connection Book or a Manual Book is reflected in the availability of wagers in the Place Wager and Record Wager screens.&nbsp; After changing Policy, you must close and re-open either of these screens if they were open before the policy change was made.&nbsp; If something is not available in Policy, then it is not available on these screens.&nbsp; If a wager type is not available in Policy, it will not be available on these screens.&nbsp; If money lines or buy points are not available in multi-play wagers, they will not be available on these screens.&nbsp; If you are offered up to a 5 play parlay in Policy, you are offered only up to a 5 play parlay on the these screens.&nbsp; Policy being reflected on this screen assures you that what you are placing is available.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>IMPORTANT:</B>&nbsp; <B>Many Policy settings are pre-assigned by us.&nbsp; They are the most common ones and have been pre-assigned by us in the interest of saving you time.&nbsp; They, however, are not necessarily indicative of what your Book's Policy is.&nbsp; Please carefully review all Policy assignments before you are finished.&nbsp; You may need to change or delete amounts, settings, odds, or behavior to reflect that of the Book.
