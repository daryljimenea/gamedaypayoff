<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>IMPORTANT:</B>&nbsp; College games featuring one or both of the teams being Non-Division I teams are not available to wager on at this time.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Record Wager screen is used to enter wagers for any Book in which a </FONT><A HREF="hs40.htm"><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Direct Connection</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> was not used.&nbsp; These types of wagers would include Books for which a </FONT><A HREF="hs40.htm"><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Direct Connection</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> had never been established or for a Book in which a </FONT><A HREF="hs40.htm"><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Direct Connection</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> is typically used, but was not used for the placing of this particular wager.&nbsp; Both the Book and the Player will be manually entering the wager using this screen.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Policy has a big affect on this screen.&nbsp; If something is not available in Policy, then it is not available on this screen.&nbsp; If a wager type is not available in Policy, it will not be available on this screen.&nbsp; If money lines or buy points are not available in multi-play wagers, they are not available on this screen.&nbsp; If you are offered up to a 5 play parlay in Policy, you are offered only up to a 5 play parlay on the record wager screen.&nbsp; Policy being reflected on this screen assures you that what you are placing is available to be recorded.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The lines received on this screen are coming from us.&nbsp; They are Vegas lines at any given time.&nbsp; These are suggested lines and not necessarily those given from the Book.&nbsp; They show up to you when we get them.&nbsp; When new lines become available, "New wager offerings available (click to view)" will flash in blue at the bottom.&nbsp; Upon clicking that flashing statement, new offerings will be made available to you.&nbsp; These new offerings are new games entirely that were never listed.&nbsp; The flashing statement does not represent new lines or updated lines within a game that is already listed.&nbsp; If there is an "NL", that means there is no line coming from us.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The lines (and "NL") on this screen can be changed.&nbsp; When your Book gives you a line, you may change it by clicking that line.&nbsp; When you change it, the line will change to red indicating that the line came from the Book.&nbsp; Even if the line is the same, you can still make it red to indicate it came from him by clicking on it and hitting Ok without changing anything.&nbsp; Hitting Cancel will keep it black.&nbsp; So, red lines would be the Book's lines that he gave to you and you manually changed and black lines would be from Vegas.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>IMPORTANT:</B>&nbsp; Closing the screen or changing Books will cause all lines changes to be lost.&nbsp; Ideally, you will enter the wager for a given Book and save it right then.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">All wagers entered on this screen can be deleted in the Wager Manager.&nbsp; This is allowed because of discrepancies that might arise between the Book and the Player.&nbsp; This is commonplace when engaging in manual operations and it is for this reason that we strongly recommend using a </FONT><A HREF="hs40.htm"><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Direct Connection</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> between the Book and Player.&nbsp; When you delete a wager, you can always come back to this screen and re-enter it correctly if required.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Because wagers can be entered at anytime on this screen, there is no expiration.&nbsp; Also, in order to find a team easier, you can use the Find Team dropdown list.&nbsp; Whenever you see a team listed multiple times, it means that the team has played many times during the time interval that you have requested.&nbsp; The lower the team within its own listing, the longer ago that it played.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">To record a wager with a Book, first choose one from the Book dropdown list.&nbsp; Any Book may be chosen whether it is a Direct Connection Book or a Manual Book.&nbsp; Once you have entered your wager, hit the Save Wagers button.&nbsp; A Save Wager Status dialog will appear.&nbsp; Its sole purpose is to check the wagers against Limits before recording them.&nbsp; If they are in violation of Limits, those wagers will not be recorded anywhere and cannot be viewed again once you close this dialog.&nbsp; If they are not in violation of Limits, they will be placed in the Open tab (and possibly the In Progress tab) or the Closed tab depending if they have been resolved or not.&nbsp; Changing wager types before saving the wager(s) will result in those wagers being lost.&nbsp; They will not be there when you return to that wager type.
