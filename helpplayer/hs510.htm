<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">If you are showing a red ball in the lower left hand corner for a Book, that means that he is failing to authenticate you as a registered Player with him.&nbsp; This could be due to unforeseen technical difficulties or he has decided to revoke your </FONT><A HREF="hs40.htm"><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Direct Connection</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> privileges by making you Inactive.&nbsp; If he has revoked your privileges, the Book setting your status back to Active will result in authentication.&nbsp; As soon as you know you are Active again, close the application and re-open it.&nbsp; You should have a green ball with the Book and be authenticated.&nbsp; If this does not occur and you are still not authenticated, then have him send you another Invite and Re-Register.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>WARNING:</B>&nbsp; When re-registering, make sure that you assign the Invite to the correct Book.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>WARNING:</B>&nbsp; You can always change a Book from a Manual Book to a Direct Connection Book through the Book Maintenance screen.&nbsp; However, once your Book is a Direct Connection Book, you cannot change them to a Manual Book.&nbsp; You can still do everything with that Book accept change Policy (because that comes directly from the Book).&nbsp; If you need your Direct Connection Book to be a Manual Book, you must delete that Book and start over.&nbsp; It is highly recommended that you write down the balance you have and any rules/odds settings before deleting.
