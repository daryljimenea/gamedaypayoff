<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE="5"><B>User Profiles</B></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">GameDay Payoff&nbsp; - Player application was designed to be used for multiple players.&nbsp; User Profiles is where you manage who has access to the application and what kind of access they have.&nbsp; At any given time, there can only be one user logged in at a time.&nbsp; Upon launching the application for the first time, you will have access to everything as an administrator.&nbsp; As an administrator, you will always have access to all features within the application, including this User Profiles dialog.&nbsp; The difference between an administrator and just a regular user is access to this dialog.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">At anytime, you may want to password protect the application as an administrator.&nbsp; To do so, either go to "Change Password" underneath the Player menu or go to this dialog.&nbsp; Through this dialog, make sure "Admin" is highlighted and hit the "Change Password" button.&nbsp; Once you have the "Change Password" dialog up, enter your password, confirm it, and provide a hint.&nbsp; It is strongly advised that you enter a password and associated hint that no one will know but you.&nbsp; At anytime after you have a password, you may revert back to no password requirement (or blank) by repeating this process and checking "Use Blank Password" from the Change Password dialog.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>IMPORTANT:&nbsp; The password you enter is case sensitive.&nbsp; Also, if you forget your password when the application is password protected, you will NEVER GAIN ACCESS to the application.&nbsp; There is no hidden password or means of getting around a forgotten password.&nbsp; You will have to do a full uninstall (see topic "Uninstall Book/Player" in Help) of the application and start everything all over again.</B></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">For all other users, they may be assigned with administrative privileges or not.&nbsp; Again, the difference between the two is access to User Profiles.&nbsp; When setting up a new user, hit the "Add User" button.&nbsp; Give the user a unique user name (no two can have the same name) and decide their privileges.&nbsp; Either enter their password information or let them.&nbsp; If you set them up with a password, they can always change it later.&nbsp; To change their username or password, hit the "Change Profile" button and make such changes.&nbsp; To delete a user, highlight them and hit the "Delete User" button.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>IMPORTANT:&nbsp; Deleting a user is permanent.&nbsp; Their profile, settings, and history can never be recovered.</B></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>IMPORTANT:&nbsp; The Administrator and any subsequent users that are assigned as Administrators have access to the User Profile and can, therefore, change anything and everything regarding users.&nbsp; This includes changing names, passwords, deleting, or adding users.&nbsp; Even the original Administrator may be deleted or have their password changed.</B></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>IMPORTANT (Regular User):&nbsp; If you are a regular user, any user with Administrator privileges may lock you out by changing your password and/or delete you.&nbsp; They can even change your password and then gain access to your account.&nbsp; If you do not want to risk being in such a situation, please get your own GameDay Payoff and retain rights as an administrator.</B></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">A user lacking Administrative privileges may change their password at anytime, but cannot change their user name.&nbsp; You can change your password by going under the Player menu and choosing "Change Password".</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">When finished using the application, log out or exit the application.&nbsp; Either choice will end your session and require a password to re-enter if you are a password protected user.
