<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">A Parlay is a single wager that links together two or more individual wagers and is dependent on all of those wagers winning together.&nbsp; For more on what a Parlay is, refer to Parlay Wagers in the Wager Types section of the Help.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">This screen is not accessible if Parlays are not being offered and is demonstrated as such in the Parlay Rules tab.&nbsp; If it is offered, the odds for each Parlay are reflected in the table by "Win" and "Bet".&nbsp; It is important to note that if a field is blank, that Parlay is not offered.&nbsp; Additionally, you cannot skip plays being offered.&nbsp; There cannot be a gap in offerings for plays.&nbsp; Example:&nbsp; you cannot have a 2, 3, and then 5 play with no 4 play offered.&nbsp; The main reason for this is if there is a push and the odds are reduced to the next lowest number, it would not work if it was not offered.&nbsp; For instance, in the example, if it was a 5 play parlay and there was a push or no action with one of the plays, there would be no 4 play to drop the odds to.&nbsp; Since this scenario cannot feasibly be handled, it is not allowed.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Parlays are designated in the Wager Manager by Parlay (#plays).&nbsp; They are available to all sports and plays within the same Parlay may come from different sports.
