<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Every time the application starts, it triggers the InstallAware update process by which a check is performed to see if an update exists.&nbsp; If one does exist, a pop up will appear asking you to choose updates to download.&nbsp; Close both applications and the hit the Download button.&nbsp; A progress bar will immediately race to the end and then after a short wait, you will be prompted to install.&nbsp; Upon being prompted, hit the Install button and wait until the dialog disappears.&nbsp; Once it disappears, you have successfully downloaded and installed the latest version of GameDay Payoff - Book and/or Player version.&nbsp; You may then re-launch your application.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">It is highly recommended that you do update the application whenever prompted to do so.&nbsp; Serious bugs, crashes, and behavior problems may exist if you fail to download and install each update received.&nbsp; If you choose to cancel and not update at that time, you will be prompted each time you start the application until the update is successfully applied.
