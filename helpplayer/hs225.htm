<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The "Validate Subscription on this Computer" dialog will come up for a variety of reasons, but they all reflect the same issue.&nbsp; When GameDay Payoff (Player and/or Book) is initially installed on your computer, the application(s) is assigned a unique subscription key (or number) that is registered with us.&nbsp; This unique subscription key cannot be changed.&nbsp; The only time this unique registration key will be the same on two different applications is when a Player application and a Book application are installed on the same computer.&nbsp; Installing on different computers and transferring to the same computer does not result in the same subscription key.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">At any one time, only one occurrence of that unique subscription key can be receiving data from us unless those identical subscription keys are on the same computer.&nbsp; That is why a Player and a Book that were installed on the same computer, and assigned the same unique subscription key because of that, will work so long as they are always on the same computer together.&nbsp; If the Player or Book application is transferred to another computer, while the other remains, either one or the other can be running for it to work properly.&nbsp; Additionally, there may be a requirement to keep validating the subscription every time you launch.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">If there is ever an instance by which you cannot validate the subscription, that means that there is an application currently running on another machine that is sharing your unique subscription key.&nbsp; The only way this could occur is if there is a copy of your database on another computer running at the same time or Book and Player applications that were originally installed on the same computer are running at the same time.&nbsp; In either case, you will not be able to run your application until that application with your unique subscription key shuts down.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">If you are aware of who might be sharing your unique subscription key, it is best to have them get their own application and their own database.&nbsp; If you do not know who is sharing your subscription key or cannot get them to stop, you will need to do a full uninstall (see topic "</FONT><A HREF="hs140.htm"><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Uninstall Book/Player</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">" in Help) on whichever application you are having trouble with and re-install it.&nbsp; Of course, this will lead you to completely start over.
