<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">After an initial round of in-house testing, we are releasing GameDay Payoff to be tested by the public.&nbsp; This pre-release version is called beta.&nbsp; Since we could not possibly test the software under all possible conditions, it is reasonable to expect that wider use of the software may uncover problems that were not discovered during in-house testing.&nbsp; These problems may be minor in nature or could be as serious as the application experiencing a hard crash.&nbsp; If the application experiences a dialog coming up with an application error, it is strongly recommended that you close the application and bring it up again.&nbsp; If you do not, the application may be unstable moving forward and experience further interruptions.&nbsp; By closing and re-opening the application, whatever caused the problem will probably be taken care of by this remedy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Please notify us through the Forum when you experience such problems so that we can take corrective action by issuing updates to resolve the defect.&nbsp; If you have a crash whereby you have a screen that offers you a "Copy Clipboard" option, please do so and paste it in the Forum under Defects.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Thank you for your patience as we value your feedback on improving GameDay Payoff for its official release.
