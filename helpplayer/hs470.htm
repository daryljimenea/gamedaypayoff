<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>IMPORTANT:</B>&nbsp; The filter results here will not necessarily match up with the contest results.&nbsp; This is because the results here are recorded according to when a wager closes, while contest results are determined by the start time of the game that closes out the wager.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Closed tab shows all wagers that the Book has that are currently resolved.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Wagers in the Closed tab may be one of 3 colors.&nbsp; They represent the following:</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">1)&nbsp; Dark Green - Wager is Won.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">3)&nbsp; Dark Red - Wager is Lost.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">4)&nbsp; Dark Yellow - Wager has Pushed.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">A total wager that is currently being played may be resolved once the total is reached.&nbsp; Meaning, once a total is reached, an over will be closed with a win and an under will be closed with a loss even though the game is still be played.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Any wager that has a red "X" next to it may be deleted.&nbsp; This is a wager that was entered through the Record Wager screen.&nbsp; If there is not a red "X" next to the wager, it was placed and accepted through the Place Wager screen via Direct Connection Book and cannot be deleted.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">For the filter, going back "0" days represents the "Today".&nbsp; Going back one day would be "today" and "yesterday".&nbsp; That pattern follows when going back days.
