<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The GameDay Payoff - Player application is compatible with both GameDay Payoff - Bar and GameDay Payoff - Book.&nbsp; There really only two differences.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">When using the Player with a Bar, all Bar Books must be Direct Connection Books.&nbsp; When using the Player with personal Books, they may be Direct Connection (recommended) or manual Books.&nbsp; The second difference is that you will always have access to your Bar Books, but you will lose access to your personal Books if you allow your subscription to expire.
