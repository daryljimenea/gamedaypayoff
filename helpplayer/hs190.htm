<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE="5"><B>Calculating Odds</B></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">There are two considerations when determining how your wager will be calculated.&nbsp; If there are no money lines or points bought, your wager is based on Fixed Odds calculations.&nbsp; Fixed odds are the odds that your book has supplied to you for any given parlay, teaser, or pleaser.&nbsp; They are very straightforward and are calculated simply by taking the amount you wagered times the Win amount divided by the Bet amount.&nbsp; For example, if the fixed odds given to you for a 2 play parlay are Win 13 and Bet 5 and you placed a $50 wager, it would be calculated as follows:&nbsp; $50 x 13 / 5 = $130</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">For multi-play wagers (parlay, teasers, or pleasers) in which there are money lines or points bought, it is required that True Odds be used for calculating purposes.&nbsp; Calculating true odds requires you to find the odds of each individual play within the multi-play wager.&nbsp; The formula to find the individual odds is based on the following: (1 + IO)^NP = MPO whereby IO = Individual Odds; NP = The number of plays for that particular multi-play wager; MPO = Multi-Play Odds.&nbsp; Viewing the table below, Parlays would calculate out like this for each Individual Odds.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Column A is the number of plays</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Column B represents the actual statistical odds of winning that parlay without juice or line considerations</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Column C is what the payout would be if each play was given a 10% juice, which translates to a -110 line or a .91 payout</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Column D are standard parlay odds offered by many sportsbooks</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Column E represents what that translates into as a payout for each individual play (.91 standard) using (1 + IO) ^ NP = MPO</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Column F represents what that translates into as a line (-110 standard)</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Column G represents what that translates into as juice (10% standard)</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">You can see that as the number of plays in a parlay exceeds 5, you are typically paying a premium to place that wager.&nbsp; With that being said, the foundation is now in place to be able to calculate multi-play wagers involving money lines or points bought.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT D, E, F, AND G ARE BASED ON TYPICAL PARLAY ODDS.&nbsp; YOUR BOOK MAY BE OFFERING YOU DIFFERENT ODDS.&nbsp; THE EXAMPLE BELOW WILL ONLY WORK FOR THESE ODDS.&nbsp; TO ARRIVE AT YOUR BOOKS INDIVIDUAL ODDS BASED ON HIS PARLAY ODDS, YOU MUST USE THE FORMULA PROVIDED ABOVE.&nbsp; ALSO, POINTS BOUGHT AND MONEY LINES WILL NEVER BE IN THE SAME PLAY.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Example:</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">6 Play Parlay with the following:</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">1st Play = -135</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">2nd Play = +150</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">3rd Play = over 42</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">4th Play = spread -7 with buying a half point at 5% juice</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">5th Play = -210</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">6th Play = over 41 with buying 2 points for a total of 20% juice</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">What is the Payout?</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">As stated, the Individual Odds (IO) for each play within the parlay need to be determined.&nbsp; Money lines are straightforward, while spreads and totals become a bit more complicated especially when buying points with them.&nbsp; Evaluating each play within the parlay will help you arrive at the payout.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">1st Play:&nbsp; to translate a negative money line into odds you divide 100 by it and make it positive.&nbsp; Therefore 100 / -135 x -1 = 0.74074 for IO</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">2nd Play:&nbsp; to translate a positive money line into odds you simply divide it by 100.&nbsp; Therefore 150 / 100 = 1.5 for IO</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">3rd Play:&nbsp; using the chart above, the individual odds for a non money line straight bet with no points bought would be 0.81782</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">4th Play:&nbsp; 5% juice for the point bought is -105 or 100 / -105 x -1 = 0.95238.&nbsp; Now multiply that times the basis of 0.81782 to arrive at 0.77888 for the IO</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">5th Play:&nbsp; same as the first play.&nbsp; Therefore 100 / -210 x -1 = 0.47619 for IO</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">6th Play:&nbsp; much like the 4th play.&nbsp; 20% juice for the point bought is -120 or 100 / -120 x -1 = 0.83333.&nbsp; Now multiply that times the basis of 0.81782 to arrive at 0.68152 for the IO</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Now that we have the individual odds for each play in the parlay, we need to apply our formula to arrive at the MPO (or multi-play odds).&nbsp; Again, using (1 + IO) ^ NP = MPO.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">(1 + 1st Play) x (1 + 2nd Play) x (1 + 3rd Play) x (1 + 4th Play) x (1 + 5th Play) x (1 + 6th Play) - 1 = MPO</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">(1 + 0.74074) x (1 + 1.5) x (1 + 0.81782) x (1 + 0.77888) x (1 + 0.47619) x (1 + 0.68152) - 1 = MPO</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">(1.74074) x (2.5) x (1.81782) x (1.77888) x (1.47619) x (1.68152) - 1 = MPO</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">MPO = 33.93138</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">To sum up True Odds calculations:&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">1)&nbsp; Take the multi-play odds provided by your Book and calculate the Individual Odds Basis by using the formula: (1 + IO) ^ NP = MPO</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">2)&nbsp; Then evaluate each play for what it's new individual odds will be based on that basis.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">3)&nbsp; Take the newly calculated separate individual odds and then apply them back into the formula (1 + IO) ^ NP = MPO to figure out the odds for the multi-play wager.
