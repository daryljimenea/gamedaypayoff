<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">A Parlay is a single wager that links together two or more individual wagers and is dependent on all of those wagers winning together.&nbsp; For more on what a Parlay is, refer to Parlay Wagers in the Wager Types section of the Help.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Parlays may or may not be offered by your Book.&nbsp; Then, if they are offered, they may or may not allow money lines in them.&nbsp; When conditions dictate, there may be a tie (or push) and/or no action for a play(s) within the Parlay.&nbsp; When such situations arise, this screen allows it to be handled to Book specifications.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Parlays are designated in the Wager Manager by Parlay (#plays).&nbsp; They are available to all sports and plays within the same Parlay may come from different sports.
