<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">A spread bet is a type of straight wager and is one of the most common forms of sports betting where you pick in advance which team will win the game.&nbsp; There will generally be a line or point spread as part of the bet. If the number is positive (+), then you add the points to your team's score. If the number is negative (-), then subtract those points from your team's score. The side with the higher score after the points are applied is the winner.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Example: Cowboys -6 (Favorite)</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Rams +6 (Underdog)</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">If you place a straight wager on the Cowboys at -6 then the Cowboys must win by 7 or more points for you to win the wager.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">If you place a straight bet on the Rams at +6, they cannot lose by more than 5 points for you to win the wager.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In the event of the game landing on 6 points, the game is a push, resulting in "no action".
