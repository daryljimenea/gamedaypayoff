<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">To receive your 1 year extension, just get a Bar to sign up for GameDay Payoff - Bar and use the email address that we have on file for you.&nbsp; Let them know that they will have a place to enter your email address.&nbsp; Once they do it and we process it, the next time you open your application, your date will be extended for an entire year.&nbsp; You can sign up as many Bars as you can and the date will just keep getting pushed back.
