<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">If you have a Direct Connection Book, the lines you receive on the Place Wagers screen is coming directly from the Book.&nbsp; For a Manual Book, the Place Wager screen is not even available.&nbsp; The Place Wager screen is the only screen in the application that receives lines directly from your Book.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Record Wager screen for both applications and the Line Monitor on the Book is receiving lines directly from our customized data feed.&nbsp; Regardless of whether or not you have a Direct Connection Book, the Record Wager screen reflects our lines that we send to you and may not be indicative of those your Book is offering.&nbsp; For lines that come from us, we choose from a consortium of Las Vegas line feeds.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Scores are also provided to you from a data feed that we get.&nbsp; These scores are vital to resolving wagers and are refreshed every 20 seconds.&nbsp; In most cases, the lag time between actual events and our data being received by you is between 30 seconds and 5 minutes.
