<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The review tab is where a wager is placed if it has not yet been sent, has expired, or has failed to be accepted by the Book.&nbsp; <U>Only wagers from the Place Wager screen are in the Review tab.</U>&nbsp;&nbsp; Wagers from the Record Wager screen are not handled by a Direct Connection Book so they cannot be waiting to be sent, expire before they make it to him, or fail for reasons from that Book.&nbsp; Wagers in the review tab are not yet recorded with your Direct Connection Book and, therefore, require further action.&nbsp; Wagers in the Review tab have three status.&nbsp; All wagers appear at all times, but by changing the status (which is not a filter) and the view, you can seek most any information on a wager you desire.&nbsp; The different status breaks down as follows:</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><U>Review:</U>&nbsp; These wagers have been sent here from the Place Wager screen.&nbsp; Instead of sending these wagers directly to the Book from the Place Wager screen, you chose to send them here to further evaluate.&nbsp; Sending the wagers here first has many advantages to sending them directly to the Book.&nbsp; You can evaluate all the wagers that you are sending so that you do not go over your limit before getting wagers in that you really wanted.&nbsp; You can also edit individual wagers for amounts or lower the number of individual plays within multi-play wager types.&nbsp; You may also have to accept a line change.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">If the Book changes lines that affect wagers that you have in Review, you will be prompted to "Accept New Line" before you can send it.&nbsp; You will also a have red line in the New Line column so that you may compare it to the Line you had when you sent it to Review.&nbsp; Until you accept the new line, you will be unable to send the wager and the send checkbox cannot be checked until you do accept the new line.&nbsp; If a multi-play wager has a play in it with a new line, the send checkbox will also be inactive until you accept the new line(s) in the individual play(s).</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">To figure out if you are sending wagers that exceed your limit, select the "Send All" to checkmark all wagers available to send.&nbsp; If a wager is not checkmarked (or cannot become checkmarked), that means that it has expired or a line within that wager has changed and it must be approved by you.&nbsp; For multi-play wagers, expand the wager by hitting the "+" sign next to it and then accept the line change if you so wish.&nbsp; For wagers that have expired, you can delete them either as individuals or within multi-play wagers.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">As you checkmark the wagers you want to send to your Book, the Send Amount above is subtracted from the Available to Wager giving you an updated Limit Management amount.&nbsp; If this amount is negative and red, you will not be able to send the checkmarked wagers until you uncheck some, edit the amounts, or delete them.&nbsp; Once you have the Limit Management amount positive, you may hit the Send button and your wagers will be sent to your Book via </FONT><A HREF="hs40.htm"><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Direct Connection</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Upon sending your wagers directly to the Book, a Place Wager Status screen will come up.&nbsp; It charts the progress of your wagers as being accepted or rejected by the Book.&nbsp; An accepted wager goes straight into the Open wagers tab, while rejected wagers remain in the Review.&nbsp; This screen can only be viewed this one time so when you close it, you cannot get it back.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><U>Failed:</U>&nbsp; These wagers have been sent to the Book via </FONT><A HREF="hs40.htm"><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Direct Connection</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> through the Place Wager screen, but were rejected by the Book.&nbsp; The most common reasons for failure were because of Policy violations or line changes.&nbsp; The reason a failed wager from the Place Wager screen ends up here is because the wager can still be revised and sent to the Book.&nbsp; The reason for the failure was given to you on the Wager Status screen upon sending it to the Book, but can also be viewed by setting the status to "Review Failed" and then viewing it by specific.&nbsp; You may then edit the wager as appropriate and resend.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><U>Expired:</U>&nbsp; The wagers with Expired status are wagers that were not received by the Book before an associated game within the wager had started.&nbsp; Once a game has begun, an affected wager will change status to expired and can no longer be placed.&nbsp; Accordingly, the Send checkbox for that wager cannot be checkmarked and it can only be deleted.
