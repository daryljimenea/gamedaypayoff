<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Contests reflects only currently active contests.&nbsp; There can be any combination of Daily, Weekly, and/or Monthly contests going on at the same time.&nbsp; If the tab is green, there's currently an active contest being played.&nbsp; If the tab is yellow, there is currently no active contest being played, but there will be one beginning within 24 hours.&nbsp; If the tab is red, there is no currently active contest being played or scheduled to begin within 24 hours.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Upon signing up, you receive a $100 credit line to wager with. Then each day for each Bar, that's all you have to do is place a wager to receive an additional $100 towards your credit line (NOTE: It can be for only $1). Your credit line rolls over day to day and is completely independent of when contests start/end. Your credit line has no maximum and these transactions IN NO WAY affect your balance. Your balance is only affected by the outcome of wagers.&nbsp; The amount you have to wager with is your credit limit plus your current balance minus your open balance (placed wagers that are not yet closed). That means the better that you do, the more you have to wager with. Just in case you blow it all, we will still fund you with $10 so that you can continue to place wagers. Then you can receive your $100 the next day and get right back into it.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">To understand what the numbers in the table are representing, it is determined by game time and if the game for that wager falls within the contest date/time window.&nbsp; For multi-play wagers, think of the wager itself as the parent and the games within it as the child.&nbsp; The parent has the amount wagered, potential win, and potential loss information.&nbsp; Tthe children have the games.&nbsp; The children (games) control when the information in the parent gets used in the Contest tab.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">If there is a game within the multi-play wager that falls within a given current contest, the information from the parent will be included.&nbsp; If there is not, it won't be included.&nbsp; Here's an example.</FONT><BR>
