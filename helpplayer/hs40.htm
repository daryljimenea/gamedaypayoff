<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Quite simply, a Direct Connection is the optimal way to run your Book or be a Player.&nbsp; Direct Connection is a communication tool that allows Books and Players to operate directly through the GameDay Payoff software application.&nbsp; Direct Connection transmits and receives from one application to another directly through the internet without that transmission passing through our servers at any time.&nbsp; By using Direct Connection, you and your Book/Player open your world to 24/7 wagering, advanced wagering that only internet sportsbook's or Las Vegas offers, controlled line movement, exposure management, and persistent balance checking.&nbsp; What you eliminate by using a Direct Connection between you and your Book/Player is the hassle of phone communication, mistakes, minimal wager offerings, missed calls, blind-sided line changes, limited time slots to place wagers, and out of balance results.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">You don't even have a reason to take off for baseball anymore.&nbsp; Who cares that there's 20 games a day with complicated wager resolving?&nbsp; The application will do it all for you.&nbsp; Imagine holding shop 365 days a year and never picking up the phone or touching a calculator.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">To experience this benefit, have your Book send you an Invite and then go to Add Book and select Direct Connection after assigning a name and opening balance.&nbsp; Import the invitation file that your Book sent you, enter the password he provided to you, and then you are all set up and ready to go.&nbsp; It's really that Easy!</FONT><BR>
