<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Use Add Book to enter any new Books that you want to manage through GameDay Payoff.&nbsp; Upon hitting Add Book, you will be presented with a choice to add a Bar Book or a Personal Book.&nbsp; The choice you make will take you down one of two paths that follows.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B><U>New Bar Book:</B></U>&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Enter the name that you would like associated with that Book.&nbsp; The name chosen can always be changed later through the Book Maintenance screen.&nbsp; The balance is naturally set at $0.00 and cannot be changed.&nbsp; When finished, hit Next.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">You will then be required to Register with the Book for a Direct Connection.&nbsp; <B>In order for you to use a Bar Book, they must have sent you an invitation file and password to the email address that you provided to them when you signed up.</B>&nbsp; Assuming you have an invitation file and password from your Bar Book, hit the "Browse for invitation" button and find your ".gdp" file that the Book sent to you.&nbsp; Then enter the password that the Bar Book provided to you and hit the "Next" button.&nbsp; The password is case sensitive so make sure you enter it correctly.&nbsp; If all went well, you will have finished the invite process and you now have a </FONT><A HREF="hs40.htm"><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Direct Connection</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> established with this Bar Book.&nbsp; A congratulations will show and a "Notification" will pop up in the lower right of the screen indicating that you have received their Policy.&nbsp; If the process fails, which is indicated by a "Connection Timeout", it means that your Bar Book is currently not available.&nbsp; The Bar Book could be offline for some reason.&nbsp; You should try again soon by repeating the process.&nbsp; If you get an "Invalid password provided" error, re-enter your password (case sensitive) and try again.&nbsp; If it still does not work, have your Book Retract that invitation and issue you another one.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B><U>New Personal Book:</U></B></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">There are two types of Personal Book's that GameDay Payoff supports.&nbsp; One is a manual Book.&nbsp; A manual Book is a Book for which you are not literally placing your wagers directly from your GameDay Payoff application to the Book's GameDayPayoff application.&nbsp; Most likely, you communicate with this Book via the phone, email, or maybe a web browser.&nbsp; They are most likely a local book, casino, or an internet based sportsbook.&nbsp; Manually entering the wagers into GameDay Payoff when using these types of Book's allows you to track all wagers in real-time, evaluate positions, keep your accounting in line, and operate more efficiently.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Your other choice as to the type of Book to setup is that of a </FONT><A HREF="hs40.htm"><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Direct Connection</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">.&nbsp; It is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that you take advantage of this option.&nbsp; You will realize all the benefits of a manual Book, but with 24/7 wagering, advanced wagering that only internet sportsbook's or Las Vegas offers, real-time wager status, controlled line movement, exposure management, persistent balance checking, and more.&nbsp; Your Book must have GameDay Payoff to take advantage of the many </FONT><A HREF="hs40.htm"><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Direct Connection</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> features.&nbsp; For more about </FONT><A HREF="hs40.htm"><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Direct Connection</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">, click on the "</FONT><A HREF="hs40.htm"><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Why Use a Direct Connection?</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">" link.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><U>If you choose the Manual entry Book type</U>,&nbsp; you will be taken through a series of Policy screens.&nbsp; These policy screens cover the limits, juice, offerings, rules, and odds for the wagers offered by your Book.&nbsp; <B>Pay careful attention to values that are pre-populated within the Policy screens.</B>&nbsp; The more common offerings were placed there for convenience reasons.&nbsp; <B>They may not reflect what your Book is offering and must be adjusted accordingly.</B>&nbsp; When Policy is complete, hit Finish and your Book will be created and ready for immediate use.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><U>If you choose the Direct Connection Book type</U>, you will be taken to a registry screen.&nbsp; <B>In order for you to use a Direct Connection Book, they must have GameDay Payoff and had sent you an invitation file and password.</B>&nbsp; Assuming you have an invitation file and password from your Book, hit the "Browse for invitation" button and find your ".gdp" file that the Book sent to you.&nbsp; Then enter the password that he provided to you and hit the "Next" button.&nbsp; The password is case sensitive so make sure you enter it correctly.&nbsp; If all went well, you will have finished the invite process and you now have a </FONT><A HREF="hs40.htm"><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Direct Connection</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> with this Book.&nbsp; A congratulations will show and a "Notification" will pop up in the lower right of the screen.&nbsp; The notification lets you know whenever the Book changes their Policy on you.&nbsp; Because that is such an important piece of information, you are informed of changes immediately.&nbsp; When you establish your initial </FONT><A HREF="hs40.htm"><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Direct Connection</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> with the Book, this notification showed up because you received your initial Policy from them and you can go to Policy to view it.&nbsp; If the process fails, which is indicated by a "Connection Timeout", it means that your Book is currently not available.&nbsp; The Book could be offline or behind a firewall and unable to broadcast.&nbsp; You should give the Book a call and resolve it.&nbsp; If you get an "Invalid password provided" error, re-enter your password (case sensitive) and try again.&nbsp; If it still does not work, have your Book Retract that invitation and issue you another one.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">While changing the kind of book from Bar Book to Personal Book (or vise versa) is not possible, you can change a Personal Book from a Manual Book to a Direct Connection Book through the Book Maintenance screen.&nbsp; However, once your Book is a Direct Connection Book, you cannot change them to a Manual Book.&nbsp; You can still do everything with that Book accept change Policy (because that comes directly from the Book).&nbsp; If you need your Direct Connection Book to be a Manual Book, you must delete that Personal Book and start over.&nbsp; It is highly recommended that you write down the balance you have and any rules/odds settings before deleting.</FONT><BR>
