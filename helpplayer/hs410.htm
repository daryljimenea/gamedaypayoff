<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE="5"><B>Place Wager</B></FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>IMPORTANT:</B>&nbsp; College games featuring one or both of the teams being Non-Division I teams are not available to wager on at this time.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Place Wager screen allows the user to receive lines and transmit wagers to a Direct Connection Book.&nbsp; This screen is only to be used with Direct Connection Book's so if you are using a Manual Book, please use the Record Wager screen.&nbsp; Because the Book is sending you his lines, the lines cannot be changed by you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Games are shown for one day ahead regardless of if there is a line available AND for any game in which a line is offered regardless of how far out.&nbsp; Therefore, if there is a line available on a game, it will be displayed.&nbsp; When new lines become available, "New wager offerings available (click to view)" will flash in blue at the bottom.&nbsp; Upon clicking that flashing statement, new offerings will be made available to you.&nbsp; These new offerings are new games entirely that were never listed.&nbsp; The flashing statement does not represent&nbsp; new lines or updated lines within a game that is already listed.&nbsp; If you see a red line, that means that the Book has updated that line since you have been on the screen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Policy has a big affect on this screen.&nbsp; If something is not available in Policy, then it is not available on this screen.&nbsp; If a wager type is not available in Policy, it will not be available on this screen.&nbsp; If money lines or buy points are not available in multi-play wagers, they are not available on this screen.&nbsp; If you are offered up to a 5 play parlay in Policy, you are offered only up to a 5 play parlay on the place wager screen.&nbsp; Policy being reflected on this screen assures you that what you are placing is available to be placed.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">If you refresh the screen (close it and re-open it) and a game(s) has disappeared, it means that your computer time now matches the start time of the game.&nbsp; Once this happens, the game has expired even though the game may not have "officially" begun yet.&nbsp; On the Book side, he will reject a wager once his computer time is that of the game time.&nbsp; THEREFORE, IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE COMPUTER TIMES OF BOTH THE BOOK AND PLAYER ARE ACCURATE.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">To place a wager with a Book, first choose one from the Book dropdown list menu.&nbsp; Only Direct Connection Books will display lines.&nbsp; Manual Books will prompt you with text to go to the Record Wager screen.&nbsp; Once a Direct Connection Book is selected, choose your wager type and make your selections.&nbsp; It should be noted that if something is missing or disabled (gray and will not let you select), that wager or wager type is not available from the Book.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Once you select a wager(s), you have two choices as to what to do with it.&nbsp; You may send it(them) directly to the Book by hitting the "Send to Book" button or you may hold off on sending them to the Book by hitting the "Send to Review" button.&nbsp; If you send them directly to the Book, a Place Wager Status dialog will appear.&nbsp; It charts the progress of your wagers as being accepted or rejected by the Book.&nbsp; An accepted wager goes straight into the Open wagers tab, while rejected wagers remain in the Review.&nbsp; This screen can only be viewed this one time so when you close it, you cannot get it back.&nbsp; When you send them to review, they go to the Review tab in the Wager Manager.&nbsp; The difference between each yields different pro's and con's.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><U>Con (Send to Book):</U>&nbsp; While the Book is accepting, you may exceed your limit and have wagers after such point rejected.&nbsp; Therefore, if you have a wager you want accepted for sure, it may be last in order and never placed.&nbsp; For this, it is important to note that the wagers are sent in the order that you enter them on the screen.&nbsp;</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, times, roman, serif" SIZE="3"> •</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">&nbsp; Your information is not in front of you (unless you split screen - see Navigation/Behavior) such as limit, balances, and available in the Wager Manager.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><U>Pro (Send to Review):</U>&nbsp; You are interested in the game, but are waiting for the line to change in your favor&nbsp; </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, times, roman, serif" SIZE="3">•&nbsp; </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">You want to step back and review the big picture of just how much you are sending and maybe change amounts or wagers entirely&nbsp; •&nbsp; You can have in front of you limit, balances, and available in the Wager Manager.&nbsp; •&nbsp; You can get a breakdown of what you are sending by using the table in the upper right corner of the Wager Manager.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><U>Con (Send to Review):</U>&nbsp; You might forget about a wager and let it expire&nbsp; •&nbsp; The line might move against you&nbsp; •&nbsp; The Book might not be available when you want to send your wagers.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Changing wager types before sending the wager(s) to the Book or sending them to review will result in those wagers being lost.&nbsp; They will not be there when you return to that wager type.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">If you have the Place Wager screen open when a Book comes online, you must close it and re-open it for them to be recognized.
