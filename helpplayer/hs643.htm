<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>IMPORTANT:</B>&nbsp; The contest results here will not necessarily match up with the closed results in the Wager Manager.&nbsp; This is because the results here are determined by the start time of the game that closes out the wager, while the results in the closed tab of the Wager Manager are determined by the end time of the game that closes out the wager.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Results section reflects only closed contests.&nbsp; It provides you with a history of previously open contests.&nbsp; The results of any and all contests will automatically become available to you 24 hours after a contest closes.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Contest results rely on game times and not closing times of wagers. For instance, with recurring contests such as a Daily contest that keeps repeating, it's the game time of the wager and not the end time that determines which Daily contest the wager is in. That means if you're $25 out of 1st place for a Daily contest that's just about to end, get your new wager(s) in quick for a game that is just about to start before the contest ends. Regardless of when the game ends, the results will count and might put you over the top.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">For Multi-Play wagers (Parlay, Teaser, and Pleasers), it is the game time <B>of the game that is responsible for closing out the wager</B> that is used to determine which contest(s) the wager counts in.&nbsp; If you have a 5 play parlay and it's the 4th game that closes out the wager with a loss, it is the start time of that wager that determines which contest(s) the wager counts towards.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">There are many filtering options provided to you.&nbsp; They are as follows:</FONT><BR>
