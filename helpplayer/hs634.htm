<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Balances screen is the financial transaction center of the application.&nbsp; It is here that the opening balance, daily wager totals, payments made to the Book, amounts received from the Book, and adjustments are recorded.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Wagers are recorded directly from the Wager Manager's Closed tab.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The three other transaction types are entered by hitting the "Create New Transaction" button.&nbsp; This button is only accessible if a Book is chosen from the dropdown menu.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The four transaction types are detailed as follows:</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><U>Wagers (automatic):</U>&nbsp; These transactions are transferred daily from the Closed tab in the Wager Manager.&nbsp; They cannot be manipulated or deleted here, but the Closed tab is influenced by the Place Wager and Record Wager screens.&nbsp; Any changes made from those screens, have a direct result on the Closed tab of the Wager Manager, and hence, the Balances.&nbsp; Hitting the Wagers link in the Transaction column of the Balance List will provide you with a screen showing the wagers that determined that daily amount.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><U>Paid (manual):</U>&nbsp; These transactions are manually entered by using the "Create New Transaction" button.&nbsp; You may add comments to the transaction and these types of transactions may be deleted from the Balance List.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><U>Received (manual):</U>&nbsp; These transactions are manually entered by using the "Create New Transaction" button.&nbsp; You may add comments to the transaction and these types of transactions may be deleted from the Balance List.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><U>Adjustments (manual):</U>&nbsp; These transactions are manually entered by using the "Create New Transaction" button.&nbsp; Use this transaction when you and the Book have different balances and just cannot resolve it unless an Adjustment is made that is outside of paying, receiving, or wagering totals.&nbsp; You may add comments to the transaction and these types of transactions may be deleted from the Balance List.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">For Direct Connection Books, the current record of balance is coming directly from him.&nbsp; This way, you will always know if the balance you both show is in sync or not.&nbsp; Checking the Group by Book checkbox will give you an aggregate of all transactions within the time range specified.&nbsp; If All is chosen from the Book dropdown list, there will be an aggregate for each Book you have.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>IMPORTANT:</B>&nbsp; If the Balance between a Direct Connection Book and you are different, there are two reasons why the Book would have a different balance than you.&nbsp; The first reason being that your transactions are not the same on the Balances screen.&nbsp; The Balances screen allows for you to receive, pay, or make adjustments.&nbsp; If these transactions do not match, the balances will not be the same.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The second reason would be from the Book and you entering different (or failing to enter) wagers on the Record wager screen.&nbsp; If a wager was taken manually instead of through a </FONT><A HREF="hs40.htm"><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Direct Connection</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">, both of you would had to have entered that wager on the Record Wager screen.&nbsp; If different wagers were entered or not entered at all, the Book would be showing a different balance than you.&nbsp; Wagers using the Place Wager screen would be the same on both sides and would, therefore, not be the cause of the Book having a different balance than you.
