<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">A parlay is a single wager that links together two or more individual wagers and is dependent on all of those wagers winning together. The benefit of the parlay is that there are much higher payoffs than placing each individual wager separately since the difficulty of hitting it is much higher. If any of the bets in the parlay loses, the entire parlay loses. If any of the plays in the parlay pushes, the parlay reverts to a lower number of teams with the odds reducing accordingly.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Parlay wagers are paid out at odds higher than the typical single game bet, but still below the "true" odds. For instance, a common 2-team NFL parlay might have a payout of 13:5 if both picks are correct. In reality, however, if one assumes that each single game bet is a coin flip and would be expected to pay out at 2:1, the true payout should instead be 4:1, a substantial difference.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Parlay wagers will have spread, total, or money lines within them.&nbsp; Typically, buying points is also allowed.
