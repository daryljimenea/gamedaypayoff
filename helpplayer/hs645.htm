<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Venue section provides you with a line up of everything going on at the Bar as it relates to events and specials.&nbsp; The categories available are as follows:&nbsp; Daily Specials, Happy Hour, Bands/Music, General, Game Specials, and Televised Games.&nbsp; If it's happening at the Bar, you'll see it here so it's a great source for you if you plan on going out.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The venue for a Bar is automatically brought up once for each time you choose a previously unchosen Bar within a session.&nbsp; A session is each time you open the application.&nbsp; That means that within a session, if you go back and forth between Bar Books, it will not keep appearing.&nbsp; However, it will always appear the first time you bring a Bar Book up.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">To make things a bit easier on you, the correct tab will automatically be chosen as associated with what day it is.&nbsp; If it's Wednesday, the Wednesday tab will be chosen.&nbsp; However, if you're looking ahead, feel free to choose another day to look at.&nbsp; Every day of the week is available for your viewing.
