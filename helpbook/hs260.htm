<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">It is very important that your computer has the correct time and time zone.&nbsp; Many of the features of GameDay Payoff rely heavily on the accuracy of your computer time.&nbsp; For instance, a Direct Connection Book will not accept anymore wagers once their clock matches that of a games start time.&nbsp; A player will no longer be able to see games on the Place Wager screen when they refresh (close and re-open) it when their clock matches that of a games start time.&nbsp; Making sure that your time zone is correct also will have an affect throughout the application.&nbsp; As long as your time zone is correct, the start times of games and when wagers were placed will always be according to your time zone.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Therefore, if your system clock is not in sync with our server's clock, you will not be able to receive our feed and, thus, not be able to use the application.&nbsp; You will receive an "SVS Update Error" until the matter is resolved.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In order to take care of your computer's clock, the following will accomplish this for most computers.&nbsp; If yours is different, just go to your computers Help and type "time" or "clock" and let them guide you.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">To get started, double-click on the time in the lower right hand corner of your computer.&nbsp; Once in there, go to the "Internet Time" tab.&nbsp; Then check to "Automatically synchronize with an internet server and choose "time.windows.com" from the dropdown.&nbsp; Hit "Update Now" and you should be good to go.
