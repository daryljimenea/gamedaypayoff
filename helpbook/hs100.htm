<LI><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>Real-Time Wager Status:</B>&nbsp; Whether you are using an internet sportsbook, Las Vegas, or GameDay Payoff, you can experience the ability to know your wager status at any given time.&nbsp; Scores are applied to any wager that currently has a game being played.&nbsp; The information provided includes whether the wager is currently winning/losing, by how many points, what pace the game is on, and if you are winning/losing according to that pace.&nbsp; The total amount winning/losing is even calculated and applied separately to your current balance for a real-time balance.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>Direct Connection:</B>&nbsp; Allows a computer connection between already established local Books and his Players eliminating the need for phone calls or writing anything down.&nbsp; There is no hosting, website, or per player fee to contend with.&nbsp; The Book uses GameDay Payoff - Book version on his computer and the Player uses Game Day Payoff - Player version on their computer.&nbsp; All communication goes between those two computers with only cyber space in between.&nbsp; The encrypted signal traveling between those two computers does not even pass through us.&nbsp; Safe, fast, secure, and reliable is the only way to describe your new relationship using GameDay Payoff.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>Accounting-Made-Easy for Sports Wagering:</B>&nbsp; With all those numbers, all those computations, all those odds, payouts, balances, and transfers, it's a wonder people still have the time to place wagers.&nbsp; Since you should be focusing on one thing and one thing only, we made sure you could.&nbsp; With GameDay Payoff, let it do the grunt work while you channel your efforts where it should be.&nbsp; That being the evaluation and placing of wagers.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>Advanced Wager Offerings:</B>&nbsp; The ability to offer and place wager offerings only available to Las Vegas and internet sportsbook patrons.&nbsp; Until GameDay Payoff made it possible, Books only offered spreads, totals, some money lines, maybe a 2 or 3 play parlay, maybe a 2 or 3 play 6 point teaser, and maybe some limited point buying.&nbsp; Math and time are the limitations for Books continuing to operate old school with phones.&nbsp; Using GameDay Payoff, spreads, totals, money lines, up to 25 play parlays, up to 25 play 3 to 21 point teasers, up to 25 play 3 to 21 point pleasers, and action points are available to be offered.&nbsp; Add to that the ability to buy points in parlays, teasers, pleasers and mix money lines into parlays and you have a brand new game of which the likes have never been seen before.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>Parlays, Teasers, and Pleasers Over Multiple Days:</B>&nbsp; Other than in Las Vegas or with internet sportsbooks, you are probably not allowed to place a multi-play wager that includes action on games scattered over several days.&nbsp; With GameDay Payoff taking and tracking your wagers, what once seemed impossible now becomes routine and ordinary.&nbsp;</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>24/7 Wagering:</B>&nbsp; Why close shop when everyone else is just getting started?&nbsp; One hour blocks of time one or two times a day are not good for anyone.&nbsp; Use GameDay Payoff and stay open even while you are away or catching your z's for a night time of sleep.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>Wager Recording:</B>&nbsp; Time to throw out the spiral notebook and the pen.&nbsp; If you are not taking advantage of the </FONT><A HREF="hs40.htm"><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Direct Connection</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> between the Book and his Players, you can still use GameDay Payoff to record your wagers and take full benefit of the value gained by having a powerful, real-time software program do the monitoring and calculating for you.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>Wager Filtering/Evaluating:</B>&nbsp; Ever wondered how you do with certain teams, certain wager types, or different leagues?&nbsp; With GameDay Payoff you can answer those questions.&nbsp; Go with what you know once you know it.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>Exposure Management/Line Monitor:</B>&nbsp; A Book's biggest fear.&nbsp; You try to move your lines to stay in balance, but with everything moving so fast, you find yourself thousands out of balance.&nbsp; With GameDay Payoff, never take a hit like that again.&nbsp; Monitor your lines in real-time to control your overall exposure.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>Customized Policy Settings:</B>&nbsp; With Players across the financial spectrum, making sure that no one gets in over their head is of paramount concern.&nbsp; Some might have high credit limits while others might not be so high.&nbsp; Current protocol has the Book knowing each Player's limit, what their balance is, what is currently open, and then what they are placing to make sure they don't go over.&nbsp; Not an easy thing to do for the best of Books!&nbsp; Set customized limits, odds, rules, juice, or anything else you want for each Player and let us do the work for you.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>Big 6 Sports Offerings:</B>&nbsp; Wagering, real-time scores, schedules and box scores for the NFL, NCAA Football, NBA, NCAA Basketball, NHL, and Major League Baseball all in one software application.&nbsp; Can it get anymore convenient!</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>Security:</B>&nbsp; Realizing the sensitivity, no effort was spared.&nbsp; All data is encrypted and the structure of the security does not allow Sports Vice Solutions or those connected to you to stray anywhere they should not be.&nbsp; There is no software code in place at all to allow anyone to take over your computer, view unintended information, or to change anything once it has been recorded.&nbsp; In creating GameDay Payoff, security was stressed so that you wouldn't have to stress over security!</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>Games In Progress Scores (Only in Player version):</B>&nbsp; Anytime there is a game currently being played in the NFL, college football, NBA, college basketball, MLB, or NHL, we've got it so that means you've got it.&nbsp; It is real-time and can be sorted by league to make sure you are always current.&nbsp; You can even display more than one league at a time.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>Box Scores/Schedules (Only in Player version):</B>&nbsp; The convenience of schedules and box scores all at your fingertips.&nbsp; Sort by team, date, and/or league to see who's playing who when or statistically how teams have done in the past.
