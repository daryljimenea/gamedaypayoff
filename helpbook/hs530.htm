<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Policy is the limits, rules, and odds that you set for your Players.&nbsp; Changing Policy only affects new wagers.&nbsp; Changing Policy will never be applied to an Open or Closed wager.&nbsp; Policy is distributed by one of two ways.&nbsp; For Direct Connection Players, it comes from you and it can only be modified by you even though it is in the Player's application.&nbsp; When you change the Policy, the Player will receive a notification that such a change has occurred.&nbsp; Because of this, you will not need to communicate any changes made to Policy.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">If the Policy is for a Manual Player, you must communicate (in a non-Gameday Payoff manner) your Policy to your Players.&nbsp; For obvious reasons, it is very important that your Policy represents the same Policy that your Player has.&nbsp; Because odds and rules are referenced for wager calculations, both sides will only match if you each have the same Policy.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">New Players and those not customized are assigned the default policy.&nbsp; To make a Player have customized settings, you must hit the "Add player customization" link when "&lt;default&gt;" is showing in the Player dropdown list.&nbsp; Once a Player has customized settings and is no longer subject to the default settings, they will appear in the Player dropdown list.&nbsp; They will not be affected by default changes, but all other Players and new ones will be.&nbsp; To make a Player subject to the defaults again, choose them from the list and then highlight any tabs that are red.&nbsp; Then hit the link that defaults that tab back to default settings.&nbsp; If there are no more red tabs left, the Player will be removed from the Player list the next time you open the Policy screen.&nbsp; All changes made to the default settings will then apply to that Player.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Policy for either a Direct Connection Player or a Manual Player is reflected in the availability of wagers in the Record Wager screen.&nbsp; After changing Policy, you must close and re-open the Record Wagers screen if it was open when such Policy was changed.&nbsp; If something is not available in Policy, then it will not be available on the Record Wager screen.&nbsp; If a wager type is not available in Policy, it will not be available on this screen.&nbsp; If money lines or buy points are not available in multi-play wagers, they will not be available on this screen.&nbsp; If you are offered up to a 5 play parlay in Policy, you are offered only up to a 5 play parlay on the this screen.&nbsp; Policy being reflected on this screen assures you that what you are recording is available.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>IMPORTANT:&nbsp; Many Policy settings are pre-assigned by us.&nbsp; They are the most common ones and have been pre-assigned by us in the interest of saving you time.&nbsp; They, however, might not be indicative of what you would like to offer.&nbsp; Please carefully review all Policy assignments before you are finished.&nbsp; You may need to change or delete amounts, settings, odds, or behavior to reflect that of what you would like your Players to have.
