<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">A teaser is a group of spread bets or totals combined into one wager.&nbsp; There are no money lines in a teaser.&nbsp; The difference between a parlay and a teaser is that with a teaser, the line you bet against for each individual wager is moved to your favor by the number of points of the teaser. If the regular line is -10 and you have a&nbsp; 6-point teaser, then your line would be -4.&nbsp; For this reason, payouts are not as high as they would be with a parlay, but accordingly, your chances of winning are better.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Teaser wagers will have spread or totals within them, but not money lines.&nbsp; Typically, buying points is also allowed.
