<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Wager Manager serves as the headquarters for all wagers.&nbsp; The Wager Manager tracks wagers as they go through various stages.&nbsp; They are as follows:</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">1)&nbsp; Open:&nbsp; A wager that you currently have accepted, but is not yet resolved.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">2)&nbsp; In Progress:&nbsp; An Open wager that currently has a game being played that will affect the wager.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">3)&nbsp; Closed:&nbsp; A wager that you currently have that is resolved.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>All screens have a Print button.&nbsp; You can Print out from this page to help reconcile a difference with a Player.</B></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>IMPORTANT:&nbsp; All wagers and amounts are from your Player's perspective!&nbsp; Therefore, your perspective would be opposite of what is showing.</B></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">All wager tabs (or stages) have much in common.&nbsp; They are as follows:</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><U>Wager Types:</U>&nbsp;&nbsp; There is Straight, Parlay (#plays), Teaser (#plays),(#points), Pleaser (#plays),(#points), and Action Points (cap)</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><U>Bet Option:</U>&nbsp; It will always be Spread, Over, Under, or Money Line.&nbsp; It is blank on the main line of a Multi-Play wager, but contained within the plays.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><U>Overall Limit:</U>&nbsp; The amount of exposure that you are willing to give the Player.&nbsp; This comes from Policy.&nbsp; If "All" is chosen from the Player list, this field is empty.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><U>*Current Balance:</U>&nbsp; The current balance you have with the Player.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><U>Open Balance:</U>&nbsp; The amount of wagers that the Player currently has, but is not yet resolved.&nbsp; The amount used for this treats every wager as if it is a loss and, therefore, includes the juice.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><U>Available to Wager:</U>&nbsp; The amount that a Player can wager with.&nbsp; It is calculated by subtracting or adding the Current Balance (depending on if they're in the red or black) to the Overall Limit and then subtracting the Open Balance from that.&nbsp; If "All" is chosen from the Player list, this field is empty.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><U>*Current (bold):</U>&nbsp; The current balance you have with the Player.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><U>Winning/Losing (bold):</U>&nbsp; Assuming the outcomes remain as they are at that moment, it is the balance of all wagers which currently have games being played.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><U>Current + Winning/Losing (bold):</U>&nbsp; The expected balance that you will have with the Player given that the outcomes of games currently being played remain as they are.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">*This amount is broadcast to your Direct Connection Player so they always know what amount you have for them.&nbsp; If the amounts do not match on his side, there are probably manual wagers entered by you or him through the Record Wager screen that the other has not OR there have been entries made through Balances by one of you that the other has not made yet.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>The table in the upper right always reflects the Wager List</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><U>Summary (table in upper right):</U>&nbsp; Breakdowns of wager types in their most basic form.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><U>Detail (table in upper right):</U>&nbsp; Breaks down each wager type even further.&nbsp; Straights become spreads, totals, and money lines while multi-plays are broken down into the number of plays.&nbsp; Action Points are broken down into the individual action point caps</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><U>Specific (table in upper right):</U>&nbsp; Breaks straight wagers down even further into the favorites and underdogs of each of spreads, totals, and money lines.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><U>Expanded view of multi-play wagers:</U>&nbsp; checking this box will expand all multi-play wagers so that you may see the individual plays within that multi-play wager.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><U>View (General or Specific):</U>&nbsp; Changing the view changes the headers (or labels) for the columns.&nbsp; The general view always offers the same headers regardless of what tab you are in while the specific view gives more relevant information to the related tab.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">A wager that has a red X (or delete) next to it was manually entered through the Record Wager screen.&nbsp; Since these wagers are recorded internally only, they may be deleted.&nbsp; If a wager does not have a red X next to it, that means that it was received and accepted from a Player through a </FONT><A HREF="hs40.htm"><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Direct Connection</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">.&nbsp; Because you received these wagers directly from the Player at the time they were placed, these wagers cannot be deleted.</FONT><BR>
