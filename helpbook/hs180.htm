<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">You can uninstall GameDay Payoff one of three ways.&nbsp; You can either use the "gamedaypayoffinstaller.exe", you can go to the Add or Remove Programs from the control panel, or go to "Start" in lower left corner, "All Programs", and then the GameDay Payoff folder where there is an uninstall.&nbsp; Any of the three methods are equally effective.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Before uninstalling, it is first recommended that you close both the Book and Player applications before proceeding.&nbsp; Once in the uninstaller, you have the following options.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">1a)&nbsp; Modify (Player or Book is already installed):&nbsp; Use the modify option if you want to install the Player if you have only the Book OR the Book if you have only the Player.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">1b)&nbsp; Modify (Both Player and Book are installed):&nbsp; Use the modify option if you are just uninstalling either the Player or the Book GameDay Payoff application.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">2)&nbsp; Repair:&nbsp; Use the repair option if you are having trouble with the application, but would like to keep all of your settings and data.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">3)&nbsp; Remove:&nbsp; Use this option if you would like to completely remove GameDay Payoff in its entirety.&nbsp; That means both the Book and the Player applications will be removed and all files related to GameDay Payoff.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">If you should decide to reinstall at a later date, your data and settings will still be there unless you do a full uninstall.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><U>FULL UNINSTALL (includes deleting .FDB file):</U></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">After doing an uninstall, go to your Windows search feature located when you hit "start" in the lower left hand of your screen.&nbsp; Then choose "All files and folders".&nbsp; Then choose "More advanced options" and check "Search hidden files and folders".&nbsp; Then in "All or part of the file name:" at the top, put in "BOOK.FDB" for Book application or "PLAYER.FDB" for Player application and hit Search.&nbsp; If you have 2 of the same, make sure that you always apply these instructions only to the one that is located in the "GameDayPayoffData" folder.&nbsp; Delete this file and you will forever lose your data and settings.&nbsp; Doing a Full Uninstall is not reversible, but should you decide to continue using GameDay Payoff after you uninstall it, you may download another installer exe from the website and start completely over.&nbsp; DOING A FULL UNINSTALL WILL NOT GET YOU AROUND PAYING.
