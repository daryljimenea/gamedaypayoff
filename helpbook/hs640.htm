<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Balances screen is the financial transaction center of the application.&nbsp; It is here that the opening balance, daily wager totals, payments made to the Book, amounts received from the Book, and adjustments are recorded.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>WARNING:</B>&nbsp; All information (including transactions created) on this screen is from Player's perspective.&nbsp; That means when you receive, you will actually use the paid transaction because the Player is paying.&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Wagers are recorded directly from the Wager Manager's Closed tab.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The three other transaction types are entered by hitting the "Create New Transaction" button.&nbsp; This button is only accessible if a Player is chosen from the dropdown menu.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The four transaction types are detailed as follows:</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><U>Wagers (automatic):</U>&nbsp; These transactions are transferred daily from the Closed tab in the Wager Manager.&nbsp; They cannot be manipulated or deleted here, but the Closed tab is influenced by the Record Wager screen.&nbsp; Any changes made on that screen have a direct result on the Closed tab of the Wager Manager, and hence, the Balances.&nbsp; Hitting the Wagers link in the Transaction column of the Balance List will provide you with a screen showing the wagers that determined that daily amount.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><U>Paid (manual):</U>&nbsp; These transactions are manually entered by using the "Create New Transaction" button.&nbsp; You may add comments to the transaction and these types of transactions may be deleted from the Balance List.&nbsp; As noted above, use this for payments for which the Player has made and thus that you have received.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><U>Received (manual):</U>&nbsp; These transactions are manually entered by using the "Create New Transaction" button.&nbsp; You may add comments to the transaction and these types of transactions may be deleted from the Balance List.&nbsp; As noted above, use this for when a Player has received and thus you have paid.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><U>Adjustments (manual):</U>&nbsp; These transactions are manually entered by using the "Create New Transaction" button.&nbsp; Use this transaction when you and the Player have different balances and just cannot resolve it unless an Adjustment is made that is outside of paying, receiving, or wagering totals.&nbsp; You may add comments to the transaction and these types of transactions may be deleted from the Balance List.&nbsp; As noted above, make sure that the direction of your adjustment is from the Player's perspective.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">For Direct Connection Players, the balance you have is being sent directly to them.&nbsp; This way, the Player will always know what balance you have to try and keep it in sync.&nbsp; Checking the Group by Player checkbox will give you an aggregate of all transactions within the time range specified.&nbsp; If All is chosen from the Player dropdown list, there will be an aggregate for each Player you have.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>IMPORTANT:</B>&nbsp; If the Player shows a different balance than you, there are two reasons why this could happen.&nbsp; The first reason being that your transactions are not the same on the Balances screen.&nbsp; The Balances screen allows for you to receive, pay, or make adjustments.&nbsp; If these transactions do not match, the balances will not be the same.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The second reason would be from you and your Player's entering different (or failing to enter) wagers on the Record wager screen.&nbsp; If a wager was taken manually instead of through a </FONT><A HREF="hs40.htm"><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Direct Connection</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">, both of you would had to have entered that wager on the Record Wager screen.&nbsp; If different wagers were entered or not entered at all, you would be showing a different balance than the Player.
