<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">1)&nbsp; You can make an adjustment in the Balance screen and just lower their overall contributions by the monthly charge for the GameDay Payoff data feed.&nbsp; With this method, they will be paying us directly, but you will be extending them a credit.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">2)&nbsp; You can pay us directly by attaching their email address to a payment made to us.&nbsp; This method will require you to make the payment to PayPal credit card processing on their behalf and by using their email address.&nbsp; Hence, they will receive the notification from PayPal that a payment has been made for them.&nbsp; They may then go through the normal process with us to have their expiration date moved back.&nbsp; HOWEVER, they must have made at least one payment to us directly in order for us to have matched up their application with a payment received on their behalf.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">1)&nbsp; Adjustment to Multiple Players with One Entry Within Application: We will be adding a feature to the balances screen whereby you may make an adjustment to every account at once. This would be handy if you were to credit your Player's for the data feed. Right now, you should consider still doing it, but manual entry for each Player is required.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">2)&nbsp; Paying for Each Player's Data Feed Through PayPal Credit Card Processing: You will be provided an easy means of paying for your Player's data feeds all at once by using our credit card processing through our website.
