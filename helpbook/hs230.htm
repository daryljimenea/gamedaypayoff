<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The lines are provided to you from a customized data feed that we put into place.&nbsp; We choose from a consortium of Las Vegas line feeds.&nbsp; These lines are sent from us into the application through the Line Monitor.&nbsp; It is through this Line Monitor that your Direct Connection Players receive their lines directly from you.&nbsp; Manual Players receive our lines and will, therefore, be different from any changes you make to the Line Monitor.&nbsp; Internally, your Record Wagers screen will also reflect the lines displaying on the Line Monitor.&nbsp; However, the Record Wager's screen must be closed and re-opened or incur a Player switch for line changes made on the Line Monitor to be reflected.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Scores are also provided to you from a data feed that we get.&nbsp; These scores are vital to resolving wagers and are refreshed every 20 seconds.&nbsp; In most cases, the lag time between actual events and our data being received by you is between 30 seconds and 5 minutes.
