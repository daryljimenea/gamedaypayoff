<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">If you have already made a payment for the data feed (even one), you may not need to ever make another payment again. Just tell a friend to enter the email address we currently have on file through your PayPal billing and we will extend your data feed expiration date by 2 weeks upon their first payment to us. You can tell as many friends as you would like and keep receiving extra free weeks.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">If you are within 34 days of initially installing the application AND within 4 days of your initial payment to us, you qualify to receive 2 weeks free just by entering the email address of record from the friend that referred you. As long as that friend has made at least one payment to us, both of you will receive 2 weeks worth of data for free. After you "Pay Apply", a "Refer A Friend" link will appear the NEXT TIME YOU OPEN THE APPLICATION. Just follow the instructions and once your friend is verified as a paying customer, both you and your friends data feed expiration dates will be moved back 2 weeks for free.</FONT><BR>
