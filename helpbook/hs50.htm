<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">If you are using the Book for fantasy, you will need to be able to broadcast lines and receive wagers.&nbsp; To do this, you will need to receive a signal that allows your Players to know that you are available.&nbsp; This signal is only identified and accepted from your invited Players, but it must be able to get in.&nbsp; Your Book will NOT work if you are at a location that cannot receive this signal.&nbsp; This may require little to no action and your Players will NOT need to do anything at all for this to work.&nbsp; ONLY on your end will something have to be done.&nbsp; For more on this, see "</FONT><A HREF="hs55.htm"><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Direct Connection Books Must Receive Signal</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">" in the Help.</FONT><BR>
