<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">A pleaser is a group of spread bets or totals combined into one wager.&nbsp; There are no money lines in a pleaser.&nbsp; The difference between a pleaser and a teaser is that with a pleaser, the line you bet against for each individual wager is moved against you instead of for you.&nbsp; If the regular line is -10 and you play a 6-point pleaser, then your line would be -16.&nbsp; For this reason, payouts are very high as compared to teasers and parlays, but accordingly, your chances of winning are much less.</FONT><BR>
