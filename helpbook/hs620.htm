<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">A Pleaser is a group of spread bets or totals combined into one wager whereby each play has points moved against you.&nbsp; For more on what a Pleaser is, refer to Pleaser Wagers in the Wager Types section of the Help.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">This screen is not accessible if you choose not to offer them in the Pleaser Rules tab.&nbsp; If it is offered, the odds for each Pleaser are reflected in the table by "Win" and "Bet".&nbsp; Each odds table has points assigned to them.&nbsp; Make sure to check each points dropdown for pre-populated odds before assigning them to your Players.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">It is important to note that if a field is blank, that Pleaser is not offered.&nbsp; Additionally, you cannot skip plays being offered.&nbsp; There cannot be a gap in offerings for plays.&nbsp; Example:&nbsp; you cannot have a 2, 3, and then 5 play with no 4 play offered.&nbsp; The main reason for this is if there is a push and the odds are reduced to the next lowest number, it would not work if it was not offered.&nbsp; For instance, in the example, if it was a 5 play pleaser and there was a push or no action with one of the plays, there would be no 4 play to drop the odds to.&nbsp; Since this scenario cannot feasibly be handled, it is not allowed.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Pleasers are designated in the Wager Manager by Pleaser (#plays),(#points).&nbsp; At this time, they are only available to football.&nbsp; However, plays within a Pleaser may be mixed between college and pro.
