<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">If you are running the Book application only, you do not have the Pro League section that is only present in the Player application.&nbsp; The Pro League section in the Player application offers you two features.&nbsp; They are Box Scores and Games In Progress.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">On the Box Scores screen you can view box scores or schedules with results.&nbsp; The box score for any game is available shortly after it becomes final.&nbsp; While only current seasons are available for each league, there are plans for past seasons to become available.&nbsp; While in the Box Scores, you can sort by league, date, or team.&nbsp; Sorting by date within a league will show every game that has been played, that is being played, or that will be played on such a date.&nbsp; Sorting by team within a league will show every game that has been played, that is being played, or that will be played by such team.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Games In Progress screen shows all games that are currently being played.&nbsp; The information on this screen is updated every 20 seconds.&nbsp; In most cases, the lag time between actual events and our data being received by you is between 30 seconds and 2 minutes.&nbsp; You can sort by league and choose to display one or more leagues at a time.&nbsp; Once a game becomes final, it will move from this screen to the box scores screen.
