<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Backing up the Database is always a good idea.&nbsp; The database contains all of your wager information and settings.&nbsp; That includes everything you need to be up and running again.&nbsp; The more often you backup the database, the better, but it is not a requirement.&nbsp; There are different databases for the Book and Player.&nbsp; To back up your database for either the Book or Player, just do as follows:</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">1) Exit the application</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">2) Go to your Windows search feature located when you hit "start" in the lower left hand of your screen and find the file "BOOK.FDB" for Book application or "PLAYER.FDB" for Player application.&nbsp; Make sure that you option to search in hidden folders and files.&nbsp; If you have 2 of the same, make sure that you always apply these instructions only to the one that is located in the "GameDayPayoffData" folder.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">3) Copy this file onto your desired medium source such as a CD, DVD, External Hard Drive, Flash Drive, main drive, or any other like product.&nbsp; It is recommended that you do not back the database onto the same computer as the original in case something physically happens to that computer.&nbsp; If you do have a backup and something happens to your computer, you will have everything you need.</FONT><BR>
