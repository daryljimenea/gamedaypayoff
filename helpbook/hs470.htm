<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The In Progress tab shows only the Open wagers that currently have a game being played that will affect that wager.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Postponed/Suspended Games:&nbsp; If a game does not start or finish, you may have wagers that are unresolved.&nbsp; For such occurrences, you may choose an Action and Apply that action to a play within a multi-play wager or to a straight wager.&nbsp; Your action will then appropriately close the wager.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Wagers in the In Progress tab may be one of 5 colors.&nbsp; They represent the following:</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">1)&nbsp; Dark Green - Play is Won.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">2)&nbsp; Light Green - Wager or play within a wager is winning.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">3)&nbsp; Light Red - Wager or play within a wager is losing.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">4)&nbsp; Dark Yellow - Play has Pushed</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">5)&nbsp; Light Yellow - Wager or play within a wager is pushing</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Neither a wager or play within a wager can be dark red because than the wager would be lost and in Closed.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Any wager that has a red "X" next to it may be deleted.&nbsp; This is a wager that was entered through the Record Wager screen.&nbsp; If there is not a red "X" next to the wager, it was accepted by you via their </FONT><A HREF="hs40.htm"><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Direct Connection</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> with you and cannot be deleted.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The refresh indicates the last time you received an update from us.&nbsp; Lines and scores are updated from us every 20 seconds.&nbsp; In most cases, the lag time between actual events and our data being received by you is between 30 seconds and 5 minutes.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>NOTE:</B>&nbsp; The winning/losing in bold may not match the totals on this tab because a wager may be Open (in the Open tab) without anything In Progress at the time.&nbsp; Such Open wagers will always be a multi-play wager with a play that has a push or a win in it.&nbsp; Realistically, you are currently winning (or pushing) a multi-play wager that has a win in it even though no play is currently in progress.&nbsp; The winning/losing amount will be reflecting those wagers in Open that have nothing in progress, but a win plus those wagers showing on the In Progress tab.
