<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">With one exception, you can move entire databases from one computer to another.&nbsp; However, you cannot move just one Player from one GameDay Payoff application to another GameDay Payoff application.&nbsp; The entire database (with ALL Players) needs to move or nothing.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The one exception to moving the entire database is that if you installed both applications on the same computer and now need them on separate computers, it will not work.&nbsp; You will need to do a full uninstall (see topic "</FONT><A HREF="hs140.htm"><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Uninstall Book/Player</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">" in Help) and start from the beginning for one of the applications.&nbsp; You can take your pick on which one you would like to remove.&nbsp; However, if you do find yourself needing to transfer both of the applications to another computer, that can easily be accomplished.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">All you need to do is move the database from the computer you are on, to the computer you want to use.&nbsp; However, copying the same database and running it on two different computers at the same time will not work.&nbsp; Neither can you merge databases if you have been working on two different computers and wish to combine the data.&nbsp; If, after following the instructions below, your application does not accept the transfer based on the subscription, please see "</FONT><A HREF="hs130.htm"><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Validate Subscription</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">" in the Help section.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">To transfer all of your settings (including subscription, direct connections, wagers, policy, etc.) to a new computer, do as follows:</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">1) On the computer you are transferring from, exit the application.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">2) Go to your Windows search feature located when you hit "start" in the lower left hand of your screen and find the file "BOOK.FDB" for Book application or "PLAYER.FDB" for Player application.&nbsp; These are the associated databases for each.&nbsp; <B>Make sure that you option to search in hidden folders and files or you will not find it.</B>&nbsp; If you have 2 of the same, make sure that you always apply these instructions only to the one that is located in the "GameDayPayoffData" folder.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">3) Copy this file onto a medium source such as a CD, DVD, External Hard Drive, Flash Drive, or any other like product.&nbsp; Before copying, make sure that the computer you are transferring to is capable of reading from that medium source so that you may transfer the database.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">4) On the computer that you are transferring the database to, install the Book application or Player application.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">5) Exit the application.&nbsp; You do not need to wait for the feed to update because you will not be using the database that the feed is being written onto.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">6) Repeat Step 2 and then jump to step 7 upon concluding this.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">7) Once the file is located on the computer you are transferring the database to, replace that file with the one from your medium source that has the database you wish to use.&nbsp; To do this, you can just copy from the medium source and paste onto the computer you are transferring to.&nbsp; When it prompts you to replace, hit Ok.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">8) Launch the application on the computer that you transferred the database to.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">9) Validate the subscription by entering the image text.&nbsp; If it does not "take", please enter again keeping in mind that an "O" can look like a "0" and an "l" can look like a "1".&nbsp; Try different like characters to make it work.&nbsp; If you cannot figure it out, just exit the application, re-open it, and then try again.&nbsp; Once you validate the subscription, you will notice that all of your settings and accounts are there.
