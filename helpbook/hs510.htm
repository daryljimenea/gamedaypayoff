<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Player Manager screen acts as the headquarters to your Players.&nbsp; This screen serves you to accomplish the following:</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><U>New Players:</U>&nbsp; To create a new Player, hit the Add Player button on the bottom of the screen.&nbsp; Upon doing so, a dialog will appear requiring you to enter the Player's name and input an opening balance (if there is one).&nbsp; You cannot enter the exact name of another Player and when you enter an opening balance, it must be entered according to the Player's perspective.&nbsp; This opening balance will appear on the Balances screen and may be adjusted from there.&nbsp; Once you hit Ok, your Player is saved and they are defaulted to being Active.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><U>Delete Player:</U>&nbsp; Highlight the Player you want deleted and hit the Delete Player button.&nbsp; Deleting a Player completely eliminates that Book's records and existence from throughout the application.&nbsp; Deleting a Player is PERMANENT and cannot be reversed so give careful consideration before doing so.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><U>Basic Information (tab):</U>&nbsp; You can use the Basic Information screen (tab) to change a Player's name, view their last activity, and make them Active/Inactive.&nbsp; To change a Player's name, highlight them in the Player list and then change their name in the Name field.&nbsp; If you do not want a Player to connect to you, but also do not want them permanently deleted, make them Inactive by unchecking the Active checkbox.&nbsp; While they are Inactive, they will not be able to communicate with you at all through the GameDay Payoff applications.&nbsp; To make them Active again, just check the Active checkbox.&nbsp; You will not have to send another Invite and they will again be able to communicate directly through the applications.&nbsp; For all these steps, make sure that you hit the Save button when prompted to do so.</FONT><BR>
