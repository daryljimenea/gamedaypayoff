<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE="5"><B>Line Monitor</B></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Line Monitor screen is used to manage the lines you are offering.&nbsp; The lines in the Line Monitor are applied to all Players.&nbsp; They are not only applied to the Player in the Player dropdown list.&nbsp; Any line showing here, or any line changes that you make, is broadcast to your Players and internally to your Record Wagers screen.&nbsp; For Players to receive lines or changes, you need not do anything.&nbsp; For your Record Wagers screen to reflect updated lines, the screen must be closed and re-opened or you must switch Players.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Whether the wager comes from a Direct Connection Player or from you manually entering the wager through the Record Wager screen, they are immediately reflected on this screen in the appropriate place.&nbsp; Keep in mind, ONLY STRAIGHT WAGERS are registered here.&nbsp; Games that are part of any multi-play wager or action points are not reflected in the Line Monitor.&nbsp; Also, when a straight wager is placed that has Buy Points in it, only the original line is considered.&nbsp; If a line has moved between the time a Player places the wager and you accepting it, the wager will be rejected because of the line move.&nbsp; There is no instance that a wager will be accepted for a line that is no longer valid.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">You have two sources to choose from when setting the lines.&nbsp; One is to follow our feed, which are Las Vegas lines.&nbsp; If you don't want to follow our feed or we are not offering a line, you can uncheck the "Follow Feed" checkbox and enter your own.&nbsp; If there is a line available from us and you do not want that game offered at all, you cannot delete it, but you can take it off the board (OTB).</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">For any wagerable that is OTB, a Direct Connection player cannot place a wager against it.&nbsp; However, you may still record a wager against an OTB wagerable through your Record Wager screen.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">There are two ways that you can control an OTB amount.&nbsp; The first is by providing the amount at the top of the screen and hitting update.&nbsp; When doing this, it will apply to every wagerable accept for those that have custom OTB amounts.&nbsp; A custom OTB is assigned to a specific wagerable.&nbsp; Let's say that the default OTB amount is hit by a particular wagerable.&nbsp; It then goes OTB until you can get to it and make an adjustment.&nbsp; In theory, you would want to move the line to promote wagering on the other side of the wagerable.&nbsp; In doing so, you would then need to raise the OTB amount for that specific wager to allow it to be offered again.&nbsp; To have a custom OTB amount for a specific wager, you must put the cursor inside the blank box underneath the box with the checkmark.&nbsp; You may then put an amount in there and tab away from the box for it to be saved.&nbsp; As previously mentioned, you may also put $0 in this box if it has a line, but you choose to not offer that wagerable.&nbsp; Lastly, changing the default OTB amount does not affect wagerables that have a custom OTB amount assigned to them.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In monitoring your lines, there are two thresholds provided to better assist you in deciding when and in what way to move your lines.&nbsp; There is first a Warning amount and then there is the OTB amount.&nbsp; Additionally, you may then go with a custom OTB amount as previously mentioned.&nbsp; These amounts may be adjusted depending on preference.&nbsp; Based on these amounts, there is various highlighting and filtering.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><U>You can choose to turn off highlighting, but if you do not, it goes as follows:</U></FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>No Highlight:</B>&nbsp; If there is no line, the wagerable will not be highlighted.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>Green:</B>&nbsp; This indicates that the wagerable is Safe and that the out of balance is less than the Warning amount.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>Yellow:</B>&nbsp; This indicates that there is a Warning associated with the wagerable because it is greater than the Warning amount, but less than the OTB amount.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>Red:</B>&nbsp; This indicates that the wagerable is OTB.&nbsp; Regardless of whether or not the wagerable is following the default OTB amount or a custom OTB amount, if the wagerable is red, it is OTB.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>Dark Red:</B>&nbsp; If a wagerable has a custom OTB amount, the custom OTB box will be dark red.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><U>General filtering works as follows:</U></FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>Individual Sports:</B>&nbsp; At the top, you may choose to filter by sport.&nbsp; Only the sports chosen will show up.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>Hide games with no line:</B>&nbsp; If this is checked, you will not see any games that have no lines at all to them.&nbsp; If they have even one line offered, they will show.&nbsp; If they have no lines, but a line comes in while this is checked, the game will show up.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><U>Status filtering works as follows:</U></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Two things to note are that general filtering takes precedence and if a game has wagerables with two or more different status's, that game will show up if any one of the status's are chosen.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>All:</B>&nbsp; All games will show up.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>Safe:</B>&nbsp; Any game containing a wagerable that is out of balance by less than the Warning amount will show up.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>Warning:</B>&nbsp; Any game containing a wagerable that is out of balance by at least the Warning amount, but less than the OTB amount will show up.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>OTB:</B>&nbsp; Any game containing a wagerable that has met or exceeded the OTB amount will show up.&nbsp; This is regardless of whether or not that OTB came from the default or from the custom OTB setting.&nbsp; The bottom line for this filter is, if the wagerable is OTB to a Direct Connection player, it will show up here.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>Custom OTB:</B>&nbsp; Any game containing a wagerable that has a custom OTB will show up regardless of whether that wagerable is Safe, Warning, or OTB.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>Missing Lines:</B>&nbsp; If an NFL, NCAAF, NBA, or NCAAB game is missing a line for either a Spread or a Total, that game will show up.&nbsp; If an NHL or MLB game is missing a line for either a Total or a Money Line, that game will show up.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>IMPORTANT:</B>&nbsp; College games featuring one or both of the teams being Non-Division I teams are not available to wager on at this time.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>IMPORTANT:</B>&nbsp; At this time, there is no means for you to broadcast different lines for different Players at the same time.&nbsp; You can, however, give them another line by other means and then use the Record Wager screen to enter it.&nbsp; Keep in mind, though, that if they are a Direct Connection Player, they will see a different line being offered than what you are telling them by viewing their Place Wager screen.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>IMPORTANT:</B>&nbsp; Games appearing in the Line Monitor that have already begun will not accept wagers against them.&nbsp; If you see a game in the Line Monitor that has already began, it will be removed shortly on its own.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>WARNING:</B>&nbsp; It is important to know that whenever you open the application, the status of accepting wagers or not will ALWAYS be in the "Accepting Wagers from All Players" mode.&nbsp; This toggle between accepting or not is located in the tool bar next to the Player dropdown list.&nbsp; If you do not want to accept wagers, just click it.&nbsp; It will change to "Not Accepting Wagers from Any Players".&nbsp; During this mode, you will still broadcast lines, policy, and balances, but you will not be taking wagers.&nbsp; Keep in mind that when you are "Not Accepting Wagers from Any Players", they are unaware of this status until they try to send you one.
