<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Buying Points is a way for the Player to move the line in their favor.&nbsp; For more on what Buy Points is, refer to Buying Points in the Wager Types section of the Help.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Buy Points may or may not be offered by you.&nbsp; Each field is the percentage.&nbsp; Hence, for 10% Juice, you would enter a 10 into one of the fields.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">If offered, you can have them in spreads and totals within straight, parlay, teaser, and/or pleaser wagers.&nbsp; The table indicates how much extra Juice will be added onto the wager depending on how many points were bought.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In football, moving onto and off of 3 or 7 points sometimes comes at a premium.&nbsp; This amount is in addition to the regular charge attached to the point buying itself.&nbsp; Additionally, it is very important to note that when points bought take the wager through a 3 and/or 7 (onto and off), the additional juice is accumulated.
