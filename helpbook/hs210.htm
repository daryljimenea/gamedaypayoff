<LI><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>Dropdowns:</B>&nbsp; For faster navigation to any entry in a dropdown, you may click on the dropdown and then type in the first letters of the desired entry.&nbsp; You will then be taken right to it.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>Split Tabs:</B>&nbsp; Right clicking on the Tabs allows you to split screens and, therefore, see two screens at once.&nbsp; To get out of split-screen, right click again and move it back OR just close the tabs for that split screen and re-open them.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>Sorting Tables:</B>&nbsp; Any table may be sorted any way that you would like by clicking on the light colored arrow within the header of the column you are wanting to sort by.&nbsp; Each time you click on it, the data order is reversed.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>Close Tabs:</B>&nbsp; To close a tab, hit the "X" that is on the far right, but in the same row of the tabs.&nbsp; Make sure that you are on the tab (visually can see the screen associated with that tab) that you would like to close.&nbsp; Be sure to not hit the "X" in the upper right hand of that application for that will close down your application.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>SVS Feed Update:</B>&nbsp; Lines and scores are updated from us every 20 seconds.&nbsp; In most cases, the lag time between actual events and our data being received by you is between 30 seconds and 3 minutes.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>Refresh Screens:</B>&nbsp; For screens in which there are games displayed that have expired, you can close the tab and re-open it for those games to be removed.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>Adjusting Column Widths:</B>&nbsp; For data that is wider than the field it is in, you may make the column wider to read it by going to the header area and placing your cursor on the edge of the column.&nbsp; When the cursor changes to opposing horizontal arrows, you can left click and adjust the width by moving your cursor.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>Global Book/Player:</B>&nbsp; The dropdown in the upper left hand corner directly under the menus in the tool bar is a means to apply your selection (individual or all) to every screen which makes use of such selection.&nbsp; It is a global selection to the application whereby that selection is the choice for each screen you are viewing.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>Screen Settings:</B>&nbsp; The application is best designed for a screen resolution of 1070 x 724 or larger.&nbsp; This is the most common screen resolution setting.&nbsp; Failure to use 1070 x 724 or larger could result in screens that are hard to view and/or manage.&nbsp; The application is also best viewed at 100% DPI.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>Multiple Leagues:</B>&nbsp; Many screens allow you to choose one or more leagues to view features with.&nbsp; Just check or uncheck the boxes for the leagues in which you are interested in for any particular screen.&nbsp; Naturally, many screens containing multiple league options will only reflect those leagues for which are currently in season.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>Finding Screens:</B>&nbsp; All, if not most screens, can be reached by the navigational bar on the left, the tool bar underneath the menus, or within the menus.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>Navigation Bar:</B>&nbsp; The navigation bar on the far left can be moved around or hidden.&nbsp; The navigation bar cannot be closed.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">1)&nbsp; To move around the navigation bar, you have three options to choose from.&nbsp; Drop the arrow to the right of the words Navigation and choose Floating, move the cursor to anywhere in the title area where the words Navigation are and grab it with your cursor, or double click anywhere in the title area where the words Navigation are.&nbsp; Place it where you would like and to get it back where it was, double-click the area in which the words Navigation are.&nbsp; That will re-dock it.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">2)&nbsp; To hide the navigation bar, either click the thumb tack or the down arrow to Auto Hide.&nbsp; Then click anywhere in the application (besides the navigation bar) and the navigation bar will disappear.&nbsp; You can get it back by clicking the Navigation tab that will be put in its place.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>Menus Within Navigation Bar:</B>&nbsp; Menu groupings can be expanded or collapsed showing the features within by clicking on the double arrows on the write within the header.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>Tool Bar:</B>&nbsp; The tool bar, right below the menus, can be moved around, closed, or re-docked in a different spot.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">1)&nbsp; To move around the tool bar, you have two options.&nbsp; You can grab it in the left corner on the vertically dashed line and then move it or double-click on the open area to the right of all the icons.&nbsp; Place it where you would like and to get it back where it was, double-click the header area.&nbsp; That will re-dock it.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">2)&nbsp; To close the tool bar, you must perform a move function and then a close box will appear on the upper right corner of that dialog.&nbsp; Hit the "X" to close, but keep in mind, YOU MUST RESTART THE APPLICATION TO GET THE TOOL BAR BACK.&nbsp; If you are using more than one Book/Client, you will lose the ability to choose if you close this dialog.&nbsp; Then you must restart to get the choice of Books/Clients back.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">3)&nbsp; The tool bar may also be re-docked right above the menus.&nbsp; To do this, just grab it in the left corner on the vertically dashed line and move it above the menus.&nbsp; It will expand and stay there until you repeat the process to put it back or restart the application.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>Shortcuts:</B>&nbsp; Any features that have an underlined letter in the name, can be brought up by using the ALT + (that letter) at the same time.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>Hovering:</B>&nbsp; In many instances, hovering the cursor over an icon or text will provide more information.
