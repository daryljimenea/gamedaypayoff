<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">A Pleaser is a group of spread bets or totals combined into one wager whereby each play has points moved against you.&nbsp; For more on what a Pleaser is, refer to Pleaser Wagers in the Wager Types section of the Help.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Pleasers may or may not be offered by you.&nbsp; Money Lines are never allowed in them.&nbsp; When conditions dictate, there may be a tie (or push) and/or no action for a play(s) within the Pleaser.&nbsp; There may also be a situation where a 2 play Pleaser will be reduced to one game through a push or no action.&nbsp; When such situations arise, this screen allows it to be handled to your specifications.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Pleasers are designated in the Wager Manager by Pleaser (#plays),(#points).&nbsp; At this time, they are only available to football.&nbsp; However, plays within a Pleaser may be mixed between college and pro.
