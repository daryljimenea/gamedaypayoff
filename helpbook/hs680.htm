<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="1">This Agreement, as modified from time to time as described above, and including the GAMEDAY PAYOFF Privacy Policy, Terms of Service and any other policies incorporated by reference, sets forth the entire understanding and agreement between the parties. No delay or failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will constitute a waiver of such provision by GAMEDAY PAYOFF or acts as estoppel against later enforcement. Subject to the terms of the Order of Precedence set forth above, this Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and GAMEDAY PAYOFF with respect to the specific subject matter addressed herein, and governs your use of the GAMEDAY PAYOFF Application and our services, superseding any prior agreements between you and GAMEDAY PAYOFF or its affiliates or related entities relating to such subject matter, but this Agreement may be supplemented by any other agreement you enter into with GAMEDAY PAYOFF or its affiliates or related entities pursuant to a registration to access additional software or services provided by GAMEDAY PAYOFF. You may not assign any of your rights or delegate any of your obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of GAMEDAY PAYOFF. GAMEDAY PAYOFF shall not be deemed to be in breach of this Agreement due to any delay or failure of performance or interruption in the availability of the Services resulting directly or indirectly from any act of nature or other cause beyond the reasonable control of GAMEDAY PAYOFF. If any provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and that the other provisions of this Agreement remain in full force and effect. Sections 2-4, 7-15 and 18 of this Agreement will survive any expiration, cancellation or termination of this Agreement. The section headings used in this Agreement are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.</FONT><BR>
