<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The entire amount of a wager will always be taken up to the Per Wager Limit (unless it violates the Overall Limit).&nbsp; If that amount coming in triggers a game to go OTB, then depending on how you set each player's Per Wager Limit could determine just how out of balance you really are.&nbsp; Here's an example.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Let's say that you have a game you would like to go OTB if the out of balance reaches $1,000.&nbsp; Currently, it sits at $975 out of balance.&nbsp; If you have a player set with a Per Wager Limit of $750 and he places a wager, GameDay Payoff&nbsp; - Book will accept this bet and take the game OTB.&nbsp; In this scenario, you will currently be out of balance by $1,725 ($975 + $750) even though your goal was to only be out of balance by $1,000.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Given this, you may want to keep th Per Wager Limit lower for each player, as opposed to higher.&nbsp; By doing so, you will have much more control of your overall exposure.&nbsp; Your Players (or maybe even yourself) may bring up the fact that they can just keep placing the same wager over and over again until they ultimately reach the overall amount they wanted to place (bypassing the Per Wager Limit).&nbsp; That, however, is okay because when one of those wagers comes in, it may trigger an OTB so that you can immediately make an adjustment and try to get your out of balance back in line.&nbsp; Therefore, while they may place several wagers on the same offering, their lines may be different for each one they place.&nbsp; Ultimately, with the line moving, they may back off and then others will take the opposite offering and allow you to keep things in balance.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">That's the ultimate goal you strive for and GameDay Payoff makes that goal a reality!
