<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">When you Log Out from the application, you close your account, but the application remains running unless you exit.&nbsp; This way, you can have the application up and running without worrying about anyone having access.&nbsp; To completely close the application, use the Exit under the File menu or the Close box in the upper right hand corner of the application.&nbsp; Closing the application also serves as logging the user out.&nbsp; Meaning, whenever the application is launched, password protected users will have to re-enter their password to log in.
