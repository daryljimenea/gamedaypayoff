<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">On occasion, you will experience an error within the GameDay Payoff application that will best be served with us obtaining your database and log files.&nbsp; While the very nature of software precludes it always being perfect, we do try and stay on top of these things and act with urgency.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">If you do experience a problem and we do communicate about it, we may come to the conclusion that we would like your database and log files to solve it.&nbsp; Please understand that we have absolutely zero interest in the information retained on your database and our sole interest is to resolve your problem from a software perspective.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">If we do request this from you and you would like to proceed, here's what you need to do.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">1) You will need a file compression utility.&nbsp; The most common one is WinZip that creates Zip files.&nbsp; If you do not have one, we recommend getting 7-Zip to create a 7z file (<a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html" target="_blank">7-Zip Downloads</a>).</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">2) After verifying that you have a file compression utility, go to your Windows search feature located when you hit "start" in the lower left hand of your screen.&nbsp; Then choose "All files and folders".&nbsp; Then in the "All or part of the file name:" field, put in "GameDayPayoffData" and hit Search.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">3) Once the folder is found, right click on it and choose "Open Containing Folder".</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">4) Then highlight the "GameDayPayoffData" folder, right click, and choose your file compression utility.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">6) Now you have a compressed file that contains the folder that we need.&nbsp; Please email that file to gamedaypayoff@gmail.com.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Sorry for the inconvenience of doing this, but we want to get you up and running as expediently as possible.
