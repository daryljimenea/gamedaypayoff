<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">A Teaser is a group of spread bets or totals combined into one wager whereby each play has points moved in your favor.&nbsp; For more on what a Teaser is, refer to Teaser Wagers in the Wager Types section of the Help.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Teasers may or may not be offered by you.&nbsp; Money Lines are never allowed in them.&nbsp; When conditions dictate, there may be a tie (or push) and/or no action for a play(s) within the Teaser.&nbsp; There may also be a situation where a 2 play Teaser will be reduced to one game through a push or no action.&nbsp; When such situations arise, this screen allows it to be handled to your specifications.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Teasers are designated in the Wager Manager by Teaser (#plays),(#points).&nbsp; At this time, they are only available to football.&nbsp; However, plays within a Teaser may be mixed between college and pro.
