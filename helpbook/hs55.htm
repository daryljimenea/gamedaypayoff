<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">1) Simply calling one of your Direct Connection Players and verifying that you are online and authenticated is the easiest way to verify you are broadcasting.&nbsp; If you are online and authenticated by your Player, you are good to go and do need to proceed any further in this Help topic.&nbsp; OR</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">2) Install the Player application (if not installed already), use the Player Manager in the Book application to create a Player Invite to set yourself up (if not already setup) as a Direct Connection Player, and then add yourself as a Direct Connection Book through Add Book on the Player application.&nbsp; If the Invite works, the signal is making it in and you are broadcasting out to your Direct Connection Players.&nbsp; There is no need to proceed any further in this Help topic.&nbsp; If step 2 does not work, you still might be receiving this signal and must revert back to step 1 for verification from another.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><U>Do Not Already Have Direct Connection Players</U></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">1) Install the Player application (if not installed already), use the Player Manager in the Book application to create a Player Invite to set yourself up (if not already setup) as a Direct Connection Player, and then add yourself as a Direct Connection Book through Add Book on the Player application.&nbsp; If the Invite works, the signal is making it in and you are broadcasting out to your Direct Connection Players.&nbsp; If step 1 does not work, you still might be receiving this signal and must Go to step 2.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">2) You must setup a Player with a </FONT><A HREF="hs40.htm"><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Direct Connection</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> by sending them an Invite.&nbsp; If they are able to set you up as their Book by showing you online and being authenticated, then you are receiving this signal and broadcasting to them.&nbsp; You do not need to proceed any further in this Help topic.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">If you cannot establish a </FONT><A HREF="hs40.htm"><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Direct Connection</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> with your Players, the next step to take is to determine if you have firewall software on your computer.&nbsp; Some common ones are Windows Firewall, ZoneAlarm, Outpost Firewall, Norton Personal Firewall, and McAfee Personal Firewall.&nbsp; If you have any one of these, or any other firewall software protection, you must allow an exception for "GameDayPayoffBook".&nbsp; Make sure that the exception is "Always" on.&nbsp; You must also make sure to open (or forward) port 23210.&nbsp; Please refer to your software instructions on how to do so.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">If you are still unable to receive this signal and are unable to broadcast to your Direct Connection Players, you MUST take action within your network's hardware/software to resolve this.&nbsp; If you do not have access to your network, then you will not be able to take such required action and you will not be able to broadcast to your Direct Connection Players.&nbsp; If you do have access to your network, such corrective action could require one or both of the following:</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">1) <U>Network Router (wired or wireless):</U>&nbsp; In order for GameDay Payoff - Book to operate correctly in </FONT><A HREF="hs40.htm"><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Direct Connection</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> mode, port 23210 on your router MUST be forwarded.&nbsp; Since there are so many router types, it is not possible for us to instruct you on how to do so given that each router is different.&nbsp; You should reference your routers instructions on how to do so.&nbsp; You can also Go to www.PortForward.com to learn all about this process and how to make it easier.&nbsp; They even offer an inexpensive program you can purchase that will automatically do this for you in seconds.&nbsp; It is called PCConfig and could save you a lot of time and effort.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">2) <U>Double (or Triple)-Firewalled Protection:</U>&nbsp; In rare cases, taking steps one or two will not work.&nbsp; If so, you are operating behind a double (or even triple) firewall.&nbsp; In order to operate GameDay Payoff - Book in </FONT><A HREF="hs40.htm"><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Direct Connection</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial, helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> mode, you will need to contact your ISP (internet service provider) and have them help you reconfigure your modem to bridge mode.&nbsp; This is a very common term that they will understand.&nbsp; This will allow your router's WAN/Internet port to have the outside IP address.</FONT><BR>
