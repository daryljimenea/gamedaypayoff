                  <td><p class="blueuplefttext">Features</p>
                    <p><span class="orangeboldtext">Real-Time Wager Status:</span>  <span class="whitebodytext">Whether you are using an internet sportsbook, Las Vegas, or GameDay Payoff, you can  experience the ability to know your wager status at any given time.  Scores are applied to any wager that  currently has a game being played.  The  information provided includes whether the wager is currently winning/losing, by  how many points, what pace the game is on, and if you are winning/losing  according to that pace.  The total amount  winning/losing is even calculated and applied separately to your current  balance for a real-time balance.</span></p>
                    <p><span class="orangeboldtext">Direct Connection:</span>   <span class="whitebodytext">Allows a computer connection between an already established Book and his Players eliminating the need for phone calls or writing anything down.  There is no hosting, website, per player fee,  or 3rd party software to contend with.  The Book uses GameDay Payoff - Book version on his computer and the  Player uses Game Day Payoff - Player version on their computer.  All communication goes between those two computers  with only cyber space in between.  The  encrypted signal travelling between those two computers does not even pass through us.  Safe, fast, secure, and  reliable is the only way to describe your new relationship using GameDay  Payoff.</span>                        </p>
                    <p><span class="orangeboldtext">Accounting-Made-Easy for Sports  Wagering:</span>  <span class="whitebodytext">With all those numbers, all those computations,  all those odds, payouts, balances, and transfers, it's a wonder people still  have the time to place wagers.  Since you  should be focusing on one thing and one thing only, we made sure you could.  With GameDay Payoff, let it do the grunt work  while you channel your efforts where it should be.  That being the offering and/or the evaluation  and placing of wagers.</span></p>
                    <p><span class="orangeboldtext">Advanced Wager Offerings:</span>   <span class="whitebodytext">We provide you with the ability to offer and place wager offerings only  available for Las Vegas  and internet sportsbook patrons.  Until GameDay  Payoff made it possible, Books only offered spreads, totals, some money lines,  maybe a 2 or 3 play parlay, maybe a 2 or 3 play 6 point teaser, and maybe some  limited point buying.  Math and time are  the limitations for Books continuing to operate old school with phones.  Using GameDay Payoff, spreads, totals, money  lines, up to 25 play parlays, up to 25 play 3 to 21 point teasers, up to 25  play 3 to 21 point pleasers, and action points are available to be offered.  Add to that the ability to buy points in  parlays, teasers, pleasers and mix money lines into parlays and you have a  brand new game of which the likes have never been seen before.</span></p>
                    <p><span class="orangeboldtext">Parlays, Teasers, and Pleasers Over  Multiple Days:</span>  <span class="whitebodytext">Other than in Las Vegas or with internet sportsbooks, you  are probably not allowed to place a multi-play wager that includes action on  games scattered over several days.  With  GameDay Payoff taking and tracking your wagers, what once seemed impossible now  becomes routine.</span></p>
                    <p><span class="orangeboldtext">24/7/365 Wagering:</span>   <span class="whitebodytext">Why close shop when everyone else is just getting started?  One hour blocks of time one or two times a  day are not good for anyone.  Use GameDay  Payoff and stay open even while you are away or catching your z's for a night  time of sleep.</span></p>
                    <p><span class="orangeboldtext">Wager Recording:</span>   <span class="whitebodytext">Time to throw out the spiral notebook and the pen.  If you are not taking advantage of the Direct  Connection between the Book and his Players, you can still use GameDay Payoff  to record your wagers and take full benefit of the value gained by having a  powerful, real-time software program do the monitoring and calculating for you.</span></p>
                    <p><span class="orangeboldtext">Wager Filtering/Evaluating:</span>   <span class="whitebodytext">Ever wondered how you do with certain wager types, the over or under, or  the favorite or underdog?  With GameDay  Payoff you can answer those questions.   Go with what you know once you know it.</span></p>
                    <p><span class="orangeboldtext">Exposure Management/Line Monitor:</span>   <span class="whitebodytext">A Book's biggest fear.  You try to  move your lines to stay in balance, but with everything moving so fast, you  find yourself thousands out of balance.   With GameDay Payoff, never take a hit like that again.  Monitor your lines in real-time to control  your overall exposure.</span></p>
                    <p><span class="orangeboldtext">Customized Policy Settings:</span>   <span class="whitebodytext">With Players across the financial spectrum, making sure that no one gets  in over their head is of paramount concern.   Some might have high credit limits while others might not be so  high.  Traditional methods have the Book  knowing each Player's limit, what their balance is, what is currently open, and  then what they are placing to make sure they don't go over.  That’s not an easy thing to do for even the  best of Books!  Throw in 50 to 75 players  to monitor and your objective becomes unrealistic.  Set customized limits, odds, rules, juice, or  anything else you want for each Player and let us do the work for you.</span></p>
                    <p><span class="orangeboldtext">Big 6 Sports Offerings:</span>   <span class="whitebodytext">Wagering, real-time scores, schedules and box scores for the NFL, NCAA  Football, NBA, NCAA Basketball, NHL, and Major League Baseball all in one  software application.  Can it get any more  convenient!</span></p>
                    <p><span class="orangeboldtext">Security:</span>   <span class="whitebodytext">Realizing the sensitivity, no effort was spared.  All data is encrypted and the structure of  the security does not allow Sports Vice Solutions or those connected to you to  stray anywhere they should not be.  There  is no software code in place at all to allow anyone to take over your computer,  view unintended information, or to change anything once it has been  recorded.  In creating GameDay Payoff,  security was stressed so that you wouldn't have to stress over security!</span></p>
                    <p><span class="orangeboldtext">Games In Progress Scores (Player Version Only):</span>   <span class="whitebodytext">Anytime there is a game currently being played in the NFL, NCAA  Football, NBA, NCAA Basketball, NHL, or Major League Baseball, we've got it so  that means you've got it.  It is  real-time and can be sorted by league to make sure you are always current.  You can even display more than one league at  a time.</span></p>
                    <p><span class="orangeboldtext">Box Scores/Schedules (Player Version Only):</span>   <span class="whitebodytext">The convenience of schedules and box scores all at your fingertips.  Sort by team, date, and/or league to see  who's playing who when or statistically how teams have done in the past.</span></p>
